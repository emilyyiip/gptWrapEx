I tried changing my email address but got an error message saying: "A user with this email already exists."
If you'd like to change your account email to one that’s already tied to another Notion account, you can log into the account that’s currently associated with your desired email address and delete that account to free up that email address. To do this:
Log into the account tied to your desired email address, then go toSettings→{your name}→Delete my account.
Log into the account tied to your desired email address, then go toSettings→{your name}→Delete my account.
Log into the account whose email address you want to change, then go toSettings→{your name}→Change email.
Log into the account whose email address you want to change, then go toSettings→{your name}→Change email.

What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back?
If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking?at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us at[email protected].

If you're using Notion at your company, you can make it easy for anyone to automatically join your workspace as a member when they sign in with their work email. To set this up, workspace owners can:
Go toSettings→Settings.
Go toSettings→Settings.
UnderAllowed email domains, enter any email domain that you want to grant access to automatically, like your company's email domain. You can add multiple allowed domains in this field, but you'll only be able to add domains that workspace members' accounts are under.

Your guest will receive an email with a link to the page. If they don't already use Notion, they’ll need to sign up to access your page.

Note:
If you’re not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because:Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest you’re trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace.

Before you selectInvitein the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.

From a guest's request
To make it easier for you to add guests to your workspace, Notion also allows people outside of your workspace to request access to certain pages in your workspace. This feature is available and turned on by default for all plans except Enterprise.
If you’re on a Plus or Business Plan, you can turn this setting off. Unfortunately, Free plans will not be able to turn this feature off. To do this:
OpenSettings→Security.
OpenSettings→Security.
Toggle offAllow page access requests from non-members.
Toggle offAllow page access requests from non-members.
Once the guest submits a request to access a page, a notification will be sent to the inbox of the page’s creator. The page creator can approve the request as well as adjust the level of access for that guest, or they can ignore the request.

Note:When you add someone to a page, they can automatically access all of its sub-pages by default. That being said, you can restrict or expand sub-page permissions!
Request to add a guest
Members of a workspace can request to add guests to it. This feature is available on Enterprise Plans only, and only workspace owners can enable or disable it.
Enable guest requests
To allow members to request adding guests to workspace pages, workspace owners can:
Go toSettings→Security.
Go toSettings→Security.
Make sureDisable members inviting guests to pagesis turned on, then turn onAllow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners canDisable guestswithout removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.
Make sureDisable members inviting guests to pagesis turned on, then turn onAllow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners canDisable guestswithout removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.
Once this is turned on, members will have to submit a request before they can invite a guest. Workspace owners are exempt and can continue to invite guests directly.

Note:Allow members to request adding guestsis a workspace level setting, and will override the any teamspace level guest setting. This means if a teamspace allows guests, but the workspace has enabled guest requests, members will have to submit guest invite requests to add guests to pages in the teamspace.
Request to invite a guest
If you're a workspace owner,you caninvite guests directly.
If you're a member:
Navigate to the page you want to invite a guest to. Just like with regular sharing, you must have full access permissions on the page to request to invite a guest.

Approve a guest
Guest invite requests must be approved on a per page, per guest basis.Only workspace owners can view and approve guest requests. Each request will have the email of the guest, the member who requested it, the role that was requested, and the name of the page.
A workspace owner can approve or reject a request to invite a guest directly from the notification they receive, or by going to by going toSettings→Members→Guestsand finding the requests at the top. Once a workspace owner responds to a request, the member who submitted will be notified of the decision.
Turn guests into members
Give any guest the ability to access your entire workspace by turning them into a member. On paid plans, you'll be charged for each additional member. To turn a guest into a member:
Go toSettings→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
Go toSettings→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
Check the box next to the guests you want to upgrade.

On non-Enterprise Plans, we’ll also suggest some guests who might benefit from becoming members in your workspace. To see who these guests are, go toSettings→Members→Suggestions. You can selectUpgradeto turn someone into a workspace member.
Remove a user
To remove a member or guest from a workspace, a workspace owner or a membership admin can:

FAQs
Is there a limit to how many guests I can add?
See the guest limit for your planhere →
If your workspace is above the guest limit for yourplan,new users that you share content with can only be added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they belong to your workspace's email domains. This could mean that they have anallowed email domainor an email domain matching the workspace owner’s domain or one of the workspace’sverified domains.
I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
You can only join a workspace via theJoin or create workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
How can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?
We've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:
DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!

How can I allow members in my workspace to request guests for approval?
As a workspace owner, you can disable guests for your workspace in yourworkspace security settings, but still allow members to send guest invite requests for review by the workspace owners. This provides a standardized way for guests to get access to content within your workspace, without being an all or nothing approach.

FAQs
I just made updates to a page, but I didn't receive a Slack notification.
There's a five minute delay built in to prevent these notifications from getting too noisy!Let us knowif you still aren't seeing them show up! We'll help out.
I'm trying to enable the integration in Slack's App Directory, but it just takes me to Notion's homepage.
Sorry for the confusion 🙈You can't enable the integration from Slack. You'll need to turn it on inside Notion with the instructions on this page.
What permissions are granted when the Slack integration is enabled?
Notion's integration with Slack operates on a per-page basis. When you enable the Slack integration for a specific page in your Notion workspace, you're granting Notion access to publish updates to the Slack channel of your choosing.
Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?
You can! You can do so viaSettings→My connections. For the desired integration, select “Connect another account”.
Note: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. GitHub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.
We’ll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.
I’m receiving a general  “Can’t load preview” error in my link preview.

Legal considerations for transcribing communications
Below is some general information on the laws and regulations that relate to transcriptions, as well as some best practices to consider when enabling AI Meeting Notes.

Note: This is provided for informational purposes only and isnotlegal advice. Consult with your legal counsel to evaluate your specific use case to make sure that you use AI Meeting Notes in a legally compliant manner. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of Notion complies with all applicable laws and regulations. See ourMaster Subscription AgreementandContent and Use Policyfor more information.
Laws related to transcribing communications
In the United States, certain laws require consent of at least one of the participants before recording or transcribing a call or conversation. Others require you to obtain consent from every participant before recording or transcribing a call.
Outside the United States, such as in the European Union, there are similar laws requiring consent of participants before recording or transcribing a call.
In addition to consent requirements, there may also be laws governing how you use, disclose, and secure your call recordings or transcriptions. These laws may vary depending on where your participants are located, the business sector, and industry standards.
Some best practices for transcribing communications
Obtaining Consent: Determining which consent laws apply can be complicated when meeting participants are in multiple states or countries, or if you cannot be sure about the location of one or more participants.We recommend complying with the strictest consent laws and always obtaining consent from all participants before using AI Meeting Notes to transcribe a meeting. Some other best practices:
Clearly explain to participants that you will transcribe the call using a third-party provider (e.g., Notion AI Meeting Notes).

Importing from Asana allows you to move your organization’s teams, projects, and tasks in Asana into Notion. Any member on any plan can take advantage of the Asana importer.

Importing from Asana vs. syncing Asana with Notion
Importing your Asana data into Notion is best if you want to move from Asana and use Notion as the primary tool for your work. The data will be duplicated into Notion, but not synchronized with Asana.
Synced databasesallow you to connect Asana to Notion without importing any data. You might prefer to use synced databases if you use both Asana and Notion for your work. Synced databases only go one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in Asana in order for updates to reflect in Notion.
To add a synced database from Asana, simply paste a project link right into a Notion page. Learn more about synced databaseshere →

Import logs
When your import completes, you will receive an import log in the private section of your sidebar. In this log you will find a summary of your import, including the Notion teamspace that your Asana projects and tasks were imported into.
FAQs
How are the Task assignees imported if that assignee is not present in Notion?
If the Tasks assignees imported do not have a Notion, the user would be added as a placeholder to the workspace.
These placeholder accounts will attribute comments and mentions. If and when these users sign up, they will be mapped to the corresponding placeholder account, and comments and mentions will be attributed to the correct user.

How long does it take for the Asana Importer tool to import a large number of tasks?
Import times may range from a few minutes to several hours depending up on the size of the import. You will receive an email notification once the import is complete.
Is there a limit to the number of tasks that can be imported at once?
There are no hard limits on number of tasks that can be imported, but we recommend limiting imports to 20K tasks per teamspace.
How are subtasks imported?
They are imported as subtasks (along with dependencies) that are within the same  database.
Do updates I make in my Asana account automatically get updated in Notion?
No, the import is a one-time action.
We do not maintain a connection with your Asana account and any changes you make in your Asana account after the importwill notautomatically update in Notion.
Is there a way to preview the import before they are added? Can I undo an import?
There is no way to preview or undo, but during the process you will select which specific projects you wish to import.
In addition you can easily delete specific projects or tasks within Notion. You can even delete the entire database and start over.

Back up your data
Your data is safe in Notion. Everything is stored in the cloud, and we keep per-minute backups of your page content on our server. That said, your data belongs to you, so we've made it easy to create your own backups and keep your information portable 💿
Export your entire workspace
Restore from trash
Restore from edit history
Accidental deletions

Learn more about ourprivacy policyandsecurity practices.
Export your entire workspace

Note:To verify a domain for your organization, you must be anorganization owner.
Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.
If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.
Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.
To export your workspace content:
Go toSettingsin your sidebar →General.
Go toSettingsin your sidebar →General.
Find and selectExport all workspace content.

Note:By default, pages will remain in Trash for 30 days before they are automatically removed from Trash. Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings.Learn more here →
To restore pages, go toTrash, find the page you're looking for, and click on the curved arrow icon next to it. Your page will return to where it was last in your workspace.
Restore from edit history
You can view and restore past versions of any Notion page going back several days, depending on what plan you're on.Learn more about edit history here →
Accidental deletions
Accidents happen! If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help. We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of any page in the past 30 days if you need it.
Send us a message in Notion by clicking?at the bottom right on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile), or email us at[email protected].

You’re billed upfront
You always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.
You’re billed per member, per workspace
Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in a workspace. One seat is assigned to each member in a workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.
If you have multiple paid Notion workspaces, you’ll be billed for them separately based on how many members you have in each. This applies even if you’re using the same Notion account for those workspaces, and even if the same people are in multiple workspaces. You can also have different billing intervals per workspace.
Go toSettingsin your sidebar →Peopleto view how many paid seats a workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage workspace members here.
Accidental member additions
Before you add someone to your workspace as a member, remember thatadding members to a paid Notion workspace is a billable action and will incur additional charges on your invoice.
If you don’t want to add a new member to your workspace but would like to collaborate with people via Notion, you can invitegueststo specific Notionpagesinstead, provided you haven’t metyour plan’s guest limit. Guests get access at the page level and are more limited in what they can do in a Notion workspace. Learn more about members and guestshere →
To avoid accidentally adding members to your workspace, go to the Notion page you want to invite a guest to, selectShareat the top of that page, and after you enter their email address, hover over their email address to confirm that they’re being added as a guest before you selectInvite.
You’ll be asked if you’d like to upgrade the guest to a member — selectSkip for nowto ensure that they’ll be added to that page at no cost.
Adding and removing members
Here’s what happens when you add or remove members.
When you add members to your workspace
When you remove members from your workspace
Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, we review how many members you've added and issue invoices on a monthly basis.
You have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your current billing interval. You can add new members before the end of your current billing interval to fill these seats at no additional charge.
Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, changes made in the middle of a billing interval are reflected retroactively in your next invoice.
At the end of your current billing interval, we recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.
You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.

Let’s look at a quick example of what happens when you remove members from your workspace.
Say your team is working with three contractors who have been added as members to your Notion workspace.

When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.
When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.
Until the end of your current billing period (monthly or annual), you can fill these three paid seats in Notion with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member — at no additional cost.
Until the end of your current billing period (monthly or annual), you can fill these three paid seats in Notion with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member — at no additional cost.
Once your current billing period is over, we’ll review how many paid seats are actually being used in your workspace and adjust your following invoice accordingly.

Yearly vs. monthly billing
You can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.
Yearly billing costs less.

Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.

Change from monthly to yearly
When you change from monthly to yearly, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.
Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.
For example:
Let's say you’re on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.

My paid workspace just got downgraded to a free plan. What happened?
You may have an unpaid invoice on your account — our system will automatically downgrade a paid account after several attempts are made to collect payment.
That said, you can re-upgrade via theUpgradetab inSettingsand settle your unpaid invoices from there. Send us a message if you need help!
I just upgraded to a paid plan, but one of my workspaces still says it's on a free plan.
Plans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.More on that here.
How can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?
We've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:
DisableWorkspace Access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
DisableWorkspace Access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
On every page,grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
On every page,grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull Accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!

Blocking
With Notion Calendar, you can easily let people see when you are or aren't available 🚫
Block an event or an entire calendar
Remove blocking
Have a doctor’s appointment that you don’t want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendar’s blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know you’re busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.
Block an event or an entire calendar
On desktop or web:
Right-click an event and selectBlock on calendar.
Right-click an event and selectBlock on calendar.
Select the calendar you want to create a block in.
Select the calendar you want to create a block in.
To create a block for a single event, selectThis event. Alternatively, you can selectAll events from {calendar name}to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.
To create a block for a single event, selectThis event. Alternatively, you can selectAll events from {calendar name}to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.
Choose toInclude detailsfrom the original calendar event in the block, or simplyShow as busy. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.
Choose toInclude detailsfrom the original calendar event in the block, or simplyShow as busy. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.

To see what details you’ve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a🔒next to the calendar where the block was set up — if the lock is open, that means the event’s details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the event’s details are hidden.
Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details.
Remove blocking
You can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.
You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to. We’re working to improve this experience, but in the meantime you can reach out to[email protected].

Board view groups your database pages by a specific property. Whereas kanban boards typically group to-do items by their status, board views in Notion can be grouped by status, assignee, priority, and more depending on what you need. They can also show you exactly what you want to see via filters, sorts, and custom database properties.
Create a board
To add a board to your workspace:
Create a new page in your workspace.

You can add a board to an existing database to view its data in that format. To do this:
Click+next to the name of your database or the name of your current database view.
Click+next to the name of your database or the name of your current database view.
SelectBoardfrom the dropdown menu.

By default, your board will be grouped by a status property if your database has one. Otherwise, your database items will be grouped by a select, person, multi-select, or relation property that’s in your database. If none of these properties exist, a new status property will be created in your database for you.
Edit your board's groups
Group by a different property
If you want to group your board by assignee, for example, instead of status, you can change the property that your board is grouping by. To do this:
Open the settings menu at the top right of your database →Group.
Open the settings menu at the top right of your database →Group.
Find and select the property you’d like to group by.

Let’s say you want to group by a property that doesn’t already exist in your database. For example, maybe you want to start assigning a priority to your tasks and organizing them by priority. You’ll need to add a new priority property. To do this:
Open the settings menu at the top right of your database →Edit properties.

SelectLayout→Open pages in→Full page.
SelectLayout→Open pages in→Full page.

Is there a way to add background colors to board cards?
Not at the moment, unfortunately. It's a popular feature request though, so definitely on our radar! For the time being, you can use Select and Multi-select properties to add a pop of color to your cards 🎨
Any way to group by a relation or formula property?
Not currently 😓 It’s a legit use case though, and definitely something we want to support in the future.
I have a "Done" column in my board that's getting a bit crowded. Can I archive these automatically?
We'd recommend hiding this column. You can do this by clicking the•••icon next to the column heading and selectingHide. You can drag any completed tasks into this hidden archive by clicking and dragging your cards into that tag underHidden Columns.

4. Databases
Databases are collections of Notion pages that help you organize information in a variety of ways. With multiple database views to choose from, you control how to display and search your content.
Articles
Intro to databases
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃
Views, filters, sorts & groups
You can view the same database in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. Within a view, you can add filters and sorts to easily categorize your content 📁
Database properties
Database properties add all kinds of context to your database items, like due dates, task owners, relevant URLs, last edited timestamps, and more. Use these properties to filter, sort, and search your data 🧩
Relations & rollups
Have you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases 🛠
Database settings
Tailor your database to your needs with lots of customization options to choose from ✨
Database templates
Most databases contain the same types of pages created over and over again. Think of weekly meeting notes, bug reports, or design specs. To make this easy, database templates let you define and replicate certain page structures with one click 🖨
Sub-items & dependencies
Use sub-items and dependencies to give depth to any workflow 🐣
Task databases & sprints
Help your team stay on track with task databases and sprints 💪
Data sources & linked databases
Need to reference database content somewhere else in your workspace? Linked databases let you show, filter, and sort the same source data across multiple locations ⛓
Optimize database load times & performance
Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼
Table view
A table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want 📊
Board view
Boards are helpful for showing items in a database as they move through stages of a process, or grouped by property 📋
Timeline view
For anyone who needs to visualize their projects plotted chronologically - whether it's hours, years, or anything in between - Notion's timeline is a type of database that keeps you on task and on track ⏳
Calendar view
Calendars let you visualize how database items connect to certain dates. Use one when you want a bird's-eye view for important launch dates, multi-day events, or even projects spanning multiple months 🗓️
List view
Lists are simple and minimalist database views. They're ideal for storing notes, articles, and documents that don't need too many properties. Every item in a list is a page that can be opened with one click and store as much content as you need 📜
Gallery view
Gallery view is the best way to display databases with visual components, like mood boards, office directories, virtual recipe boxes, and more 🖼️
Chart view
Charts help visualize the vast amount of information in your database. Customize your charts so you can see your data in the way that’s most helpful. You can even put charts from multiple databases into a Notion page to create a powerful dashboard 📊
Forms
Learn how to create, share, and gather information using forms 🖋️
Unique ID
Add an extra layer of project management by giving your tasks their own IDs 🤖
Feed view
Display database pages in stacked-card format making it easy to browse and engage with team content 🔍
Layouts
Create an organized layout for your tasks, goals, journal, or anything else you might track in a Notion database 🔨

2. Workspace & sidebar
Your Notion workspace is the home for all your content. You can work in your workspace alone or share your workspace with collaborators — it's up to you! Here, we'll teach you how to create, join, and use workspaces.
Articles
Intro to workspaces
Everything you do in Notion takes place in a workspace. It's your virtual home to organize information and create exactly the way you want — as just one person, together as a team, or across a whole company. Expand, edit, and mold it to fit your needs 🏠
Navigate with the sidebar
Notion's left-hand sidebar makes it easy to structure all the content in your workspace. Here's everything you need to know on how to organize, rearrange, and find your pages within the sidebar 🧭
Create & manage workspaces
When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘
Create & navigate teamspaces
Teamspaces help keep your content organized into specific areas. Keep your sidebar tidy by joining just the ones you need to access! Here's how 📚
Search in your workspace
Notion is designed for you to add as many layers of information as you and your team need to solve any problem. Search ensures that Notion is an easily navigable archive of information 🔍
Home & My tasks
Home gives you quick access to Notion AI, important pages, upcoming events, and your tasks 🏡
Workspaces on mobile
Here's a quick tour of how Notion workspaces look and operate on your phone or tablet 📱

1. Getting started
Welcome to the connected workspace where better, faster work happens. Let’s cover all the things you need to know to begin exploring Notion.
Articles
Start here
Curious about what Notion is? We'll show you right here, and in the articles to come. Let's go! 📍
What is a block?
Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱
Create a page
Every page you create in Notion is a fresh canvas where you can add whatever content you want. Follow these steps to create your first one 📄
Create a subpage
There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages... inside pages. Here, we'll show you how to create a page within another page, which we call a subpage 📑
What is a database?
Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄
Create a database
Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈
Start with a template
To help you take on a variety of challenges with Notion, we've created lots of templates that you can adopt and customize as your own — including some starter templates already in your workspace! Here's how to use them 💾
Share your work
Share any Notion page you create with select people, your whole team, or the entire web. It's up to you. Here's a quick overview of how to share 🗣
Collaborate with people
Notion has several features designed to improve and increase the velocity of communication with your team — whether you're all editing the same page or working across time zones 🤝

3. Pages & blocks
At its simplest, Notion can be used as a straightforward text editor — but you can spruce up your Notion pages with all kinds of blocks that are flexible and customizable.
Articles
Intro to writing & editing
Notion is first and foremost a writing tool. It works as simply as any word processor, only you can add many different types of content to a page, and move it around and modify it in new ways ✏️
Format your page
Notion is designed to get thoughts out of your head and onto the page. Once they're there, you can rearrange, organize, and structure them to think and write more clearly 📐
Style & customize your page
You can make Notion look and feel any way you want — like your brand, your team, your style. We've built in features so you can customize any page or workspace. No matter what, Notion makes your design look great 🎨
Images, files & media
Add more color to your Notion page by uploading images, videos, audio, and more 🎞️
Links & backlinks
Notion makes it easy to link to all kinds of content in and outside of your workspace 🔗
Wikis & verified pages
Use wikis and verified pages to maintain important information more easily ✅
Move & duplicate content
If you have multiple Notion workspaces or accounts, you may want to move content from one to another. We'll show you how 📦
Delete & restore content
Any content you add to Notion can be duplicated or deleted with a couple clicks, whether that's an image, embed, page, or database. And if you ever get rid of content and need to get that work back — we got you covered on that too 🖇
Synced blocks
Notion allows you to sync content blocks across multiple locations. With synced blocks, you can edit all these instances at the same time 🔄
Code blocks
Code blocks are useful to demonstrate programming concepts, share code with other developers, or maintain your own library of code snippets. They also make it a breeze to copy any amount of code to your clipboard to use elsewhere 🕹️
Math equations
On any Notion page, you can display beautifully formatted, comprehensible mathematical characters, expressions and equations. This comes in handy for note taking, technical documentation, homework, or anywhere you need to use fractions and equations 🧮
Keyboard shortcuts
Notion is fully equipped with keyboard and Markdown shortcuts so you can do everything you need without ever touching your mouse ⌨️
Duplicate public pages
You can duplicate public Notion pages to add them to your own workspace. From there, you can customize them however you want 👯

Intro to workspaces
Everything you do in Notion takes place in a workspace. It's your virtual home to organize information and create exactly the way you want — as just one person, together as a team, or across a whole company. Expand, edit, and mold it to fit your needs 🏠

Sometimes, it makes sense to put pieces of information next to each other. In these situations, you can format your text into columns (or create side-by-side sections with headings) using drag and drop:
Click and drag the text you want to put in another column. (The⋮⋮symbol in the left margin is your handle for drag and drop.)

Note:Columns are available on tablet but not mobile. On your phone, you'll see the content in any right-hand column simply placed under the content in the left column.

Remove columns
To remove columns, simply do the reverse of the action you took to create them.
Click the⋮⋮icon and hold to drag the content in your right-hand column back under or above the content in the left-hand column. When you see the blue guide span the width of the page, drop it and the columns should disappear.

Headings
You can add more structure to your pages with three levels of headings. There are many ways to add a heading to your page:
Hover over a new line and click the+that appears in the left margin. Then, select the size heading you want.

Hover over the heading or text and select the⋮⋮that appears in the left margin.
Hover over the heading or text and select the⋮⋮that appears in the left margin.
SelectTurn into.
SelectTurn into.
SelectToggle heading 1,Toggle heading 2, orToggle heading 3.
SelectToggle heading 1,Toggle heading 2, orToggle heading 3.
All of the content within those headings will now be collapsible or expandable so that you can keep your page clean. At this time, you’ll need to open and close toggles manually — there’s no way to open and close them all at once, or make them open or closed by default.
Table of contents
If you're working on a long document with lots of headings, you may want to add a table of contents to help your readers and collaborators easily skim the page’s content and easily jump to any section.
In a table of contents, you’ll see a list of all the headings used in your page. H2s and H3s will be indented to reflect your page’s structure. Click on any of the headings in your table of contents to go to that heading in the page.
A table of contents can appear in a page in two ways:
At the top of your page, as a block.
At the top of your page, as a block.
At the right side of your page as you scroll through it, as a page-level setting.
At the right side of your page as you scroll through it, as a page-level setting.
Table of contents block
There are a few ways to add a table of contents block in Notion:
Hover over a new block on your page and select+. In the menu that appears, find and selectTable of contents.

Enter/in a page and start typingtable of contents. SelectTable of contentsin the menu that appears.
Enter/in a page and start typingtable of contents. SelectTable of contentsin the menu that appears.

Note:Your table of contents block is a single unit that must be moved, deleted, duplicated, and styled as a unit. To edit the text it contains, edit the actual headings on your page.
Table of contents page-level setting
You’ll see a table of contents in the right side of your Notion page by default if your page has two or more headings. This table of contents will follow you as you scroll through the page so you can access it at any time. Hover over the table of contents to expand it and see all of the headings in your page.
If you don’t want to see a page-level table of contents:
In the page you want to remove the table of contents from, select•••→Customize page.
In the page you want to remove the table of contents from, select•••→Customize page.
Toggle offTable of contents.
Toggle offTable of contents.
Dividers
Breaking up content on a page can help you separate distinct sections and ideas. Dividers are a good way to distinguish these sections and add some stylistic flair to your page.
Click the+in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line and select theDividerblock from the menu.

FAQs
Why can't I see columns on my phone or tablet?
Unfortunately, our mobile apps don't support multiple columns yet, but it's definitely on our to-do list!
Will my table of contents show titles of in-line tables on my page?
No. Even if you give your table a name in your document, this won't be reflected in the table of contents. You can, however, add a heading above the database that will appear.
If I turn individual headings a color, will that show in my table of contents?
Your table of contents will always be all one color 🖌You can change this color, and it will will apply to the whole thing. To do this:
Click the⋮⋮icon that appears when you hover over your table of contents. Or select it and hitcmd/ctrl+/. Or right click.

Click on any of these mention notifications to go directly to the line, comment, discussion or database you've been mentioned in.

Note:If you @-mention someone on a page that they don't have access to (like one of your private pages), they will not be notified.
From your Inbox, you can also directly reply to a comment by clickingReply. You can also resolve or re-open comments.
FAQs
Someone @-mentioned me in a page, but I didn't receive an email notification.
If you have Notion open on a mobile device or computer, you won't receive push or email notifications for @-mentions. You'll only get a red badge notification in yourInbox.
If Notion is not open on your mobile device or computer at the time of the notification, then you'll receive an email instead of an inbox notification.
What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?
Link to pageworks kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.
@-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.

Common formula errors
Learn about the common errors you might run into with formulas in Notion, and how you can troubleshoot them 🔨
Permissions
Wrong return type
Formula depth limit reached
Referencing variables in other variables
Referencing variables in filters
Referencing database properties
Referencing relations and people
Undefined value
Common syntax errors
Permissions
If you don’t have access to a referenced database, formulas won’t be able to compute reliably. This is because formulas require access to the source database and its property configurations.
How to fix it
Ensure you have access toallpages and databases referenced in your formula within your button or database automation.
Wrong return type
Unlike formula properties in databases, formulas in automations expect a specific return type from the formulas (ex.: date, text, number, person). The automation will otherwise fail to save and execute properly.
How to fix it
Make sure the formula returns the correct type of value. For example, if writing a formula to set the value of a Person property of a page, the formula must return a user or list of users, not a date. Alternatively, if evaluating a specific condition on an array type property (ex.: multi-select), make sure to use.includesinstead of==in yourif()statement.
Formula depth limit reached
Notion formulas can only be15 layers deep. Every time a formula references another formula or rollup, it adds a layer. This applies even if the formula is in a different database.
When this limit is reached, Notion will show an error message.
How to fix it
Simplify your setup by combining unnecessary formulas and rollups into fewer properties. Look for places where multiple formulas do similar things and try to merge them into one.
Referencing variables in other variables
If custom variables are definedwithin the same automation action, they cannot reference each other.
For example, if you definevar1andvar2in the same action,var2won’t be able to usevar1in its definition.
How to fix it
Define each variable in itsown separate action(create the first variable, add a new action to your automation, and define the next variable separately). This ensures that each variable is properly recognized.
Referencing variables in filters
Today, variables defined in an automation may not be used to filter pages in databases you’d like the automation to act on (ex.: “Edit pages that match filter containsvariable").
How to fix it
Define a custom variable asThis pageby typingTrigger pagein the formula box.
Define a custom variable asThis pageby typingTrigger pagein the formula box.
Add anEdit pages inaction and select the custom variable from step 1 as your target.
Add anEdit pages inaction and select the custom variable from step 1 as your target.
Referencing database properties
When writing a formula in an automation, databasepropertiesmay not appear automatically. This isn’t a bug — you just need to use a specific syntax.
How to fix it
To reference database properties from the trigger page, typeTrigger page.(make sure to add.at the end). This will reveal all available property options.
Referencing relations and people
When working with relations, rollup, and person properties in formulas, the formulas return a list of pages or people. To reference properties within the relation, you’ll need to define the first element, otherwise your automation will pause. You might also encounter this issue when creating a formula that uses the map function for a relation property.
How to fix it
Use functions like.first()or.at(0)to get the first element, or loop through the list of pages with functions like.map(),.filter(),.every(),.some(),.find().
Undefined value
When formulas run on an empty value (ex.: Date, Person, etc), the automation will get an error and automatically pause.
How to fix it
Useifandempty()to check whether a value is present before running the Person or Date function on it.
For example, if your formula runs on a Person property named “Owner”, create the following if statement to force a value:if(empty(This page.Person.first()), “No person”, This page.Person.first().name()). This ensures that even if there is no Owner, the automation will safely execute.
Alternatively, set up a view that filters to the Date or Person value being defined, and apply their automation to that view.
Common syntax errors
If your formula isn’t working as expected, it might be due to a syntax error such as missing parentheses, incorrect operators, or unsupported functions. For a full breakdown of formula syntax, readthis article →

What counts as an AI response?
Everyone can try Notion AI for free.Once you've used all your complimentary AI responses, you will see a message that an upgrade to the Business or Enterprise Plan is necessary to continue using AI features. You’ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop, toupgrade your plan.
What counts as an AI response?
Every time you take an AI action (including creating new content, editing existing content, using AI blocks, adding an autofill property, asking a question, etc.) in Notion orNotion Mailand receive a response from Notion AI, that counts as an AI response. Anytime you clickTry again, that counts as an additional AI response.
The only exception iscreating a database with Notion AI— this action doesn’t count toward your complimentary responses.

Note:This feature is only available on paid plans.
Workspace owners on paid plans can connect their existing custom domains with Notion Sites by purchasing the custom domain add-on.Notion doesn’t sell custom domains or replace your current domain provider— the add-on allows you to use Notion Sites with a custom domain you already own.
Custom domain add-on pricing and billing
Once a workspace owner on a paid plan connects a custom domain with Sites, they'll be charged an additional $10 per month.Note that with annual billing, you’ll unlock a discounted rate for the custom domain add-onof an additional $8 per month.
For each custom domain you want to use with Notion Sites, you’ll have to purchase a separate custom domain add-on. You can do this for up to 25 custom domains.
Billing for the custom domain add-on must match your billing for Notion — if you pay for Notion annually, you’ll also be billed annually for the custom domain. If you pay for Notion monthly, you’ll also be billed monthly for the custom domain.
If you add a custom domain to your existing paid plan, you’ll pay a prorated amount for the remaining time left on your current billing cycle. On your next billing date, the custom domain add-on charge will be added to your regular billing cadence.

Create an account with Notion

Note:At this time, Notion Calendar iscompatible with Google and iCloud calendars. We’re working on adding support for Microsoft Outlook — checkhttps://www.notion.com/releasesandhttps://twitter.com/notioncalendarfor updates.
If you have a Notion account, you can sign up for Notion Calendar with your Notion account. If you don’t already have a Notion account, no problem — when you sign up for Notion Calendar, a Notion account will be created for you using the same email address.
Once you’re signed up, you canintegrate at least one of your calendarsto get started. Additionally, you canconnect Notion workspaces to Notion Calendarso that you can bring anydatabases with date propertiesfrom those workspaces into Notion Calendar. Additionally, you’ll be logged into the same session across Notion Calendar and Notion so that signing into and out of one will also sign you into and out of the other.

When signing up for Notion Calendar, use an email address that you’ll always be able to access. For example, you might want to use a personal account rather than a work account in case you decide to leave your work organization. The account you use to sign up will be your primary account and you need access to the primary account to access Notion Calendar. You can always connect any work accounts or secondary accounts after signup!
If you want to unlink your Notion account from Notion Calendar, learn howhere →
Only one Notion account can be linked to your Notion Calendar account, but you can always integrate multiplecalendarsandNotion workspaceswith your Notion Calendar account.
Google permissions

If you’re a Google Workspace admin and you want to restrict access to Notion Calendar or learn more about our security practices,read this article →
Notion Calendar asks only for the Google permissions that we absolutely need to make sure Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to access data on your behalf, never to read, edit, or delete it without direct action from you.Notion Calendar is verified by Google and can’t access any user data categorized as restricted. We’ll never see your Google password. You also have the ability to remove access at any time.Learn more about how we protect your data here →
Apple app-specific password
Apple requires you to use anapp-specific passwordfor Notion Calendar to connect your iCloud account. To get this app-specific password:
Log into your Apple account athttps://account.apple.com/sign-in.
Log into your Apple account athttps://account.apple.com/sign-in.
Go toApp-Specific Passwordsand create a new password.
Go toApp-Specific Passwordsand create a new password.
The app-specific password you log in with doesn’t allow Notion Calendar access to anything else than your calendar, contacts, and mail data. You can revoke your password at any time in your Apple account settings.
Change your linked Notion account
Only one Notion account can be linked to your Notion Calendar account, even if you have multiple calendars or Notion workspaces integrated with your Notion Calendar account.
This means that if you lose access to the Notion account you used to sign up for Notion Calendar, you’ll also lose access to your Notion Calendar.
If you want to change your linked Notion account, or you’ve lost access to the Notion account that you use to log into Notion Calendar, fill outthis formand provide us with the email address you’re currently using for Notion Calendar as well as the new email address you’d like to use. We’ll do our best to respond within 72 hours of your submission.

Create a subpage
There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages... inside pages. Here, we'll show you how to create a page within another page, which we call a subpage 📑
Create a subpage
Navigate with your sidebar and breadcrumbs
Rearrange your page structure
Create a subpage
A subpage is a page inside a page. You can create any number of subpages for a page.
There are multiple ways to create a subpage:
Open a page (this will be the subpage’s parent page) and use the slash command/page.
Open a page (this will be the subpage’s parent page) and use the slash command/page.
Find your desired parent page in your sidebar and select+next to it. This will create a subpage in that page. When you return to the parent page, you’ll see the subpage there.
Find your desired parent page in your sidebar and select+next to it. This will create a subpage in that page. When you return to the parent page, you’ll see the subpage there.
Once your new page opens, you can give your page a title and start jotting down your thoughts.
Need some inspiration or structure? On desktop or web, select any of the options at the bottom of the page to get started. You can import from an app or file, use a template, create a table, and more — select an option you like, and your page will be formatted accordingly!
Navigate with your sidebar and breadcrumbs
When you open the toggle for the parent page in your sidebar, you’ll see its subpages there.
Additionally, at the top of your page, you’ll see breadcrumbs that show you what page you’re in, and where that page lives.
Rearrange your page structure
The pages in your workspace can be easily rearranged.
To take a subpage out of its parent page, click on it in the sidebar and drag it out of the parent page's toggle.

You can set varying and granular permissions for different groups and teams without having to divide your people into different workspaces! Instead, create groups inside one workspace and grant them different levels of access page by page. Here's how.

Note:Guests in your workspace can't be added to groups. This feature is for members only!
Create and edit groups
Workspace owners and membership admins can create and edit groups. To do this:
Go toSettings→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Groups.
Go toSettings→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Groups.
SelectCreate a groupand enter a name for your group. To set an icon for the group, just click the emoji icon that appears on hover.

FAQs
How can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?
We've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:
DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!

Create & manage workspaces
Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.
When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘
Create a new workspace
Join an existing workspace
Switch between workspaces
Leave a workspace
Delete a workspace
Add another email account
Log out of an account
Create a new workspace
By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. To create another workspace:
Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.

Tip: Multiple workspaces come in handy to separate different kinds of work. For example, you could have one workspace for personal stuff, one for school notes, and one for keeping track of freelance projects.
Join an existing workspace
There are a couple ways to join a workspace someone else has made:
An admin from that workspace adds you as a member, and you receive an email with a link to join. You'll be prompted to sign in with your email, and you'll be placed into the workspace as a paid member.

If your email domain (e.g. name@domain.com) has auto-join enabled, you can use theJoin or create workspacebutton in the workspace switcher, and you'll see a list of workspaces you can join.

Note:If you're using Notion with a personal email address such as gmail.com or outlook.com, or a school email address such as nyu.edu, you won't be able to auto-join other workspaces.
To join a workspace from another email account, use theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher.

Switch between workspaces
Throughout the day, you might need to hop between different workspaces to get things done. Just click on the name of your current workspace and select the one you want to jump to from the dropdown menu. That's it!
You can also accessSettingsfrom the workspace switcher.

Tip:On desktop, you can use the shortcutctrl+shift+#to switch workspaces, in which#corresponds to the placement of each workspace in the dropdown workspace switcher menu.
Leave a workspace
Once you leave a workspace:
You’ll lose access to all of the content inside it. You might want toexportany data that you want to keep after you leave the workspace.

Add another email account
By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. But you may prefer to use your personal email with your personal workspaces, and your work email with your team workspaces.
To enable you to view all of your workspaces at once, we support logging in with multiple accounts at the same time!
To add workspaces from another Notion account, open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and clickAdd another account.
To add workspaces from another Notion account, open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and clickAdd another account.

The next time you open the workspace switcher, you'll see the new account and all of its workspaces added to the dropdown.
The next time you open the workspace switcher, you'll see the new account and all of its workspaces added to the dropdown.

Tip: By adding more accounts to your workspace switcher, there's no need to log out of one account in order to log into another! This lets you keep work and life separate, while making sure that you can access any of your content across any account, on any device, completely seamlessly.
Log out of an account
You can log out of individual accounts, or log out of all your accounts at once.
Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.
Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.
To log out of one account but stay logged into others, use the•••button to the right of the account you want to log out of. Then, clickLog out.

To log out of all your accounts at once, use theLog out allbutton at the bottom of the workspace switcher.

Note: Login tokens expire after 90 days. When you're logged out of your accounts due to token expiration, you will need to re-add any additional accounts by using theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher.

FAQs
How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?
Note:Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information,click here.
To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click•••next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and selectMove to.At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in thePrivatesection but can be moved wherever you want to put them.

I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
You can only join a workspace via theJoin or create workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
When I subscribe to a paid plan, does it cover all of my workspaces?
Paid plans only apply to one workspace and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate silos, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
How can I switch between workspaces that are under different email addresses?
To add your workspaces from another email account, use theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.
Is there a limit to the number of accounts I can be signed into?
There is currently no limit, although you may experience slower performance if you're logged into 10+ accounts at once.
I forgot to log out of my account on a public computer, or my device was stolen.
If you're still logged in on a device you have access to, navigate toSettings→{your name}→Log out of all devices.
If you no longer have access to your account, please send us a quick message to[email protected], or use the Notion AI face at the bottom right of the app. We can log you out remotely!

What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?
Link to pageworks kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.
@-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.

FAQs
Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?
Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
Why can't I change text size on mobile?
This styling option, along with page width, only exists on desktop and web.
What's the ideal size and aspect ratio for cover images?
The cover images are dynamic depending on the width of your window, so there's no specific size that works best. That said, we recommend using images at least 1,500 pixels wide.
How can I insert an emoji in-line with my text 🤔?
Anywhere in your text, type:followed by the name of the emoji you want to use, like:firefor 🔥 or:clappingfor 👏
You can also use your system emoji picker to include emojis in-line on a Notion page, or anywhere else on your computer!
Mac:ctrl+cmd+space
Windows 10:windows key+.orwindows key+;

Data sources & linked databases
Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.
Need to reference database content somewhere else in your workspace? Linked databases let you show, filter, and sort the same source data across multiple locations ⛓
Choosing a data source
Create a linked database
Edit linked databases
Choosing a data source
When you make a database, you’ll be given the option to select an existing data source from the workspace or to a create a brand new one.
We suggest selecting an existing data source if you want to use the same properties from another database, or an existing view living elsewhere in your workspace. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.
We suggest creating a new data source if the information you're adding to the database is completely new and doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, or if you want to keep it separate from other data. To create a new database, clickNew table,New list, etc. (depending on the type of view you are creating) in the menu that appears.
Create a linked database
Think of each linked database as a two-way excerpt of the source database. It references the same source data, but has its own views, filters, and sorts.
In a page, type/linkedand press enter.
In a page, type/linkedand press enter.
A menu will pop up that allows you to type to search for specific databases in your workspace. You can also scroll to browse.

The database you select will show up as a copy of the original, which you can filter, sort, and view differently without changing the original.

Edit linked databases
When interacting with a linked database, the views, filters, or sorts you create and delete will not affect the views on the original database.

You can add as many linked databases as you would like inline on a single page. Filter them for different purposes to create your own dashboard.

FAQs
I tried sharing a page with a linked database, but the recipient wasn't able to see it.
Whoever you share this type of page with needs to have access to the original database to be able to see any linked excerpts of that database.
Can I name my linked database something different from the original database?
Not at the moment. We've had a few users ask about this though, so it's on our to-do list!

Database automations are sequences of actions that happen any time a specific change to a database occurs. Automations consist of both triggers (the events that initiate the automation) and actions (the effect of the automation). Database automations are meant to help save you time and simplify your work, and can be very basic or more complex depending on your needs.
Database automations can be used for many things, including:
Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.
Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.
Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.

Database automation triggers
Automations can have one trigger or multiple triggers. When you set up an automation, you can decide whether the automation will take placeWhen any of these occurorWhen all of these occur.

Note:If you have multipleis editedtriggers that mustalloccur for your automation to take place, those triggers need to happen within a small window of about three seconds. If they don’t, your automation may not be triggered properly. To avoid this, you can:
Create separate automations for each trigger.
Create separate automations for each trigger.
Use a more specific trigger thanis edited, likeis set toorcontains.
Use a more specific trigger thanis edited, likeis set toorcontains.

You can choose from three types of triggers:
Page addedmeans your automation will be triggered when a new page is added to your database.
Page addedmeans your automation will be triggered when a new page is added to your database.
Property editedmeans your automation will be triggered when a specific property from your database is edited. For name, person, number, text, select, and relation properties, you can choose what kinds of edits made to that property will trigger an automation. For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person’s state being set to New Jersey.
Property editedmeans your automation will be triggered when a specific property from your database is edited.

For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person’s state being set to New Jersey.
Every {frequency}means your automation will be recurring. The trigger will happen repeatedly based on the frequency you set. You can set your automation to repeat every day, week, month, and so on. You can also set a time that the automation will be triggered, the date that the automation trigger will begin and end, and the timezone.Note:TheEvery {frequency}trigger works with all automation actions except forEdit property.

You can also set a time that the automation will be triggered, the date that the automation trigger will begin and end, and the timezone.

Note:TheEvery {frequency}trigger works with all automation actions except forEdit property.
You can have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur. Note that a recurring trigger (like one that you set to repeat every week, month, etc.) can’t be paired with another type of trigger.
Database automation actions

Note:If you’d like your automation to add or edit pages and databases, make sure that you have permission to edit those pages and databases. Additionally, make sure edited pages are available are notPrivateorShared. Otherwise, your automation won’t work.
Automations can take one action or multiple actions. You can choose from a variety of actions:
Edit propertywill edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in. For multi-select, people, and relation properties, you can add or remove individual values instead of adding or removing all values at once. For example, you might have a task database where if the task name contains the word “blog”, your name is added to the people property, even if there are other people already assigned to that task.

FAQs
How frequently is the database scanned for “changes” in properties?
Database automations work over a three second window. For example, within this three second window, a user can remove a trigger and delete any changes, resulting in no property change to the automation.

Do automations work on pages in the entire database, or pages in a single database view?
Either one. During the creation process, you can specify if the automation should run on pages in the entire database, or in a specific view. If any filters in that view change, the automation will then apply to the adjusted list of pages.

Can guests with full access to a database create automations?
Unfortunately, guests can't create database automations.

Why isn’t my database automation triggering?
If your database automation isn’t triggering, it could be because:
The automation is set to be triggered by another automation. Automations can’t currently trigger other automations. Try using a different, non-automated trigger instead.

Database templates
Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.
Most databases contain the same types of pages created over and over again. Think of weekly meeting notes, bug reports, or design specs. To make this easy, database templates let you define and replicate certain page structures with one click 🖨

Create a database template
To create a template inside a database, click the dropdown arrow next toNewat the top right of your database. Then, select+ New template.
When editing a new or existing template, you'll see a bar across the top indicating which database it's located in.
Whatever you title this page will be the name of the template you use going forward. For instance, you might title this oneBug.
On this page, you can define properties for your template. For example, you can create a template for bug reports that automatically putsP1in the Priority property and assigns the userFigto the Product Manager property. You can also add content in the page itself.
Templates can contain any type of content, including images, embeds, and sub-pages. Whatever you choose will show up identically on each page created with the template.

Note:If you add a relation property to a template, do not fill it in unless you want every page you create with that template to relate to the same existing page(s).
Use a database template
Create a new page in your database and choose any of the templates from the gray menu it contains.

Nesting database templates
You may want to create a database inside of a recurring database template, with that database having templates of its own. While this is possible, be mindful of the limitations:
You can’t nest a template within a template that recurs daily. You can only nest a template within a template that recurs weekly, monthly, or yearly.

FAQs
Are the templates I create in one database available in all other databases in my workspace?
No, they're only available in the specific database where you created them. For every new database you create, you can define new templates.
How do relation properties work with templates?
While you can create relation properties in database templates, we don't recommend that you define them unless you want every page of a certain type to be related to the same page(s).
Is there a limit to the number of database templates I can make?
Nope! You can make as many as you want.

Deploy Notion for macOS
Learn how to install and update Notion for your organization 🚀
Installing Notion on shared machines
Distribute Notion
Disable automatic updates
Allow users to update Notion
Notion's desktop app provides IT administrators with enhanced control over installations and updates. You have the flexibility to select the installation path for Notion and manage update settings. By default, the Notion app is set up in the /Applications folder on your employees’ machines and is configured to update automatically with each new release.

Note:Regular updates are crucial for access to the latest features and ensuring the highest level of security, especially if automatic updates are turned off.
Installing Notion on shared machines
Notion allows for use on shared machines by multiple users. It can be installed in either the /Applications or ~/Applications folder of a user's machine. The best installation method depends on your organization's specific needs.
/Applications
All users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.
All users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.
Updates made to Notion apply to all users on the machine.

Users must be administrators to update Notion.

~/Applications
Each user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.
Each user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.
Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.
Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.
Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.
Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.
Distribute Notion
After deciding on the installation method, download the appropriate Notion desktop app build. There are three builds available:Intel (x64),Apple Silicon (arm64), andUniversal (x64 or arm64). Ensure you distribute the correct build to match your employees' machine types.

Note:The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds.
Disable automatic updates
Notion allows you to disable automatic updates for individual users. This feature is useful for when you want to test new Notion app versions before a widespread rollout, or if you prefer to stagger the update process. To keep the app working smoothly and securely, we advise updating Notion with each new version release.
To prevent Notion from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Notion:
defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool YES
Use the following command to re-enable automatic updates:
defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool NO
Allow users to update Notion
If Notion is installed in the ~/Applications folder, users can update the app independently without needing special permissions. However, if the app is installed in the /Applications folder, update permissions are required.Users must be machine administrators and have write access to /Applications, notion.app, and all its subfiles.
For shared machines, we recommend setting up a permissions group for all Notion users and installing Notion in a subfolder of /Applications. You can grant this group ownership and write access to the subfolder using the terminal command below. Make sure you replacegroupwith your permissions group name andsubfolderwith your subfolder name:
chown -R :group /Applications/subfolder && chmod -R 775 /Applications/subfolder

Learn how to install and update Notion for your organization 🚀
Distribute Notion
Silent installation and uninstallation
Install to a custom directory
Disable automatic updates
Distribute Notion
Notion’s installer is based on the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System and supports most of the command line flags aimed at supporting IT administrators with rolling out Notion to a fleet of machines.
Silent installation and uninstallation
If you want to install Notion silently from a script, you can use the/Sparameter. With this flag, Notion will install itself without showing any user interface. Once the installation has finished, it willnotlaunch itself.
Please note that PowerShell by default does not wait for external processes to finish before moving on to the next command. If you want to wait for the installation to complete, you can use the common PowerShell trick of piping output to theOut-Nullcommand like so:
Notion Install.exe /S | Out-Null
Install to a custom directory
If you want to install Notion to a custom directory, you can use the/Dparameter.
The/Dparameter must be the last parameter in the command.
The/Dparameter must be the last parameter in the command.
There should be no quotes around the path, even if it contains spaces.
There should be no quotes around the path, even if it contains spaces.
The path must be an absolute path, not relative.
The path must be an absolute path, not relative.
Please note that Notion’s auto-updater will attempt to write to this path, so your users should have read and write permissions.
Notion Install.exe /D=C:\Custom InstallPath | Out-Null
Disable automatic updates
At this time, Notion for Windows doesn't allow disabling of automatic updates.

Embeds in Notion

As needed to display embedded content, Iframely and the embedded app may receive the IP address of the content's viewers.
Here is a selection of some of the commonly used apps that you can embed into your Notion pages:
Abstract

While pretty much any online content can be embedded on a page, Notion also has preconfigured embed blocks for some of the commonly used media types (e.g., File, Image, PDF, Video) and apps (CodePen, Loom, Miro, Tweet).
These can be added specifically from the/menu or by clicking+in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line. Try it out by typing/tweetto embed a Tweet, or/mapsto embed an interactive Google Map.

On the desktop app
There is no way to print directly from the Notion desktop app. You'll need to export your page or database as a PDF first and then print that file. Full instructions on exporting to PDF can be foundabove.
Export your entire workspace

Note:To verify a domain for your organization, you must be anorganization owner.
Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.
If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.
Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.
To export your workspace content:
Go toSettingsin your sidebar.

FAQs
I'm not seeing an export option in my ••• menu. What's the deal?
If you’re a member of an Enterprise workspace, it's possible that your workspace or teamspace owner has disabled exporting. To allow members to export content:
Workspaces owners can go toSettings→Security, then toggle offDisable export.
Workspaces owners can go toSettings→Security, then toggle offDisable export.
Teamspace owners can go toSettings→Teamspaces→•••next to your teamspace →Security, then toggle offDisable export.
Teamspace owners can go toSettings→Teamspaces→•••next to your teamspace →Security, then toggle offDisable export.
If you're a guest of the workspace, you need to haveFull accessto the page or database to see and use the export option.
Why don't I see my export downloading right away?
If a file is very large (depending on the number of sub-pages included), we may send you an email with a download link rather than automatically starting a download. This is not always the case. No email will be sent if you were able to download the file right away.

After you make a purchase, you’ll see a message on your screen that the purchase was successful, and another message that the template is ready for use in your workspace. If your purchase doesn’t go through, you won’t be able to duplicate the template into your workspace.

Note:
Once you’ve added your template to your workspace, it can be duplicated multiple times in that Notion workspace. However, the creator may have chosen to prevent you from moving the template to another workspace using Move to or by sharing. This means duplicating the template to another workspace or copying certain blocks from the template and pasting them into a page in another Notion workspace won’t be allowed.

Forms make it easy to collect information from others, even if those people aren’t part of your Notion workspace or don’t use Notion at all.All members on all Notion planscan create and use forms.
Forms are connected to databases, so each question in your form is connected to a property in your database. This way, your form lives right alongside its responses, and you can use the information you collect in the same way you use information in any other kind of database.

Once you’ve created a form, you’ll be taken to the form builder, which looks like this.
The form builder lets you decide what your form will look like and how it will work when you share it for others to fill out. To configure your form:
Give your form a title and an optional description.

Click into the questions in your form to edit them. By default, any changes you make in the form will be synced with the names of your database properties. For example, If you create a new question that asks “What time do you prefer?”, a new property with that same name will be created in your database. If you change a form question from “Favorite color” to “What’s your favorite color?”, your “Favorite color” database property will be renamed to “What’s your favorite color?”.

Intro to formulas
In a Notion database, you can add a formula property that lets you run all kinds of calculations and functions based on other properties. You can use formulas to manipulate existing data and arrive at many other helpful values 🔮
Formula examples
Example 1: Project management
Example 2: Project brainstorming
(Advanced) Example 3: Task management automation
Where formulas can be used
Create a formula
Edit a formula
What formulas are made of
Notion formulas can perform helpful calculations using your existing database properties, built-ins, and functions.
Formula examples
Let’s look at a few different ways to use formulas. If you’re ready to get started building your own, jump to our instructions on creating a formulabelow →
Example 1: Project management
In this example, we’ll use three formulas to track the progress of projects.

You can explore and play with the formula setups for this example by duplicatingthis pageto your workspace!
Goal
Property name
Formula
Functions and built-ins used
Set a project’s due date as two weeks after its start date
Due date
dateAdd(Start Date, 2, "week")
dateAdd()adds time to the date. The unit argument can be one of the following:years,quarters,months,weeks,days,hours, orminutes. In this case, we’ll useweeks.
Mark a project as overdue if the due date has passedandits status is notDone.
Mark a project as overdue in bold, red letters if the due date has passedandits status is notDone.
Overdue?
if(and(now() > Due Date, Status != "Done"), "Overdue", "")
if(and(now() > Due Date, Status != "Done"), style("Overdue", "red", "b"), "")
if()returns the first value if the condition is true; otherwise, returns the second value. This allows for a conditional outcome.
and()is a logical operator. This allows to evaluate multiple factors as being true.
now()returns the current date and time. This allows to evaluate where we stand now, compared to the project due date.
>is a comparison operator. This allows to compare the condition of due date being larger than current date.
!=is a comparison operator. This allows to define the condition of status not being equal toDone.
style()adds styles and colors to the text. Valid formatting styles includeb(bold),u(underline),i(italics),c(code), ors(strikethrough). Valid colors aregray,brown,orange,yellow,green,blue,purple,pink, andred. Add_backgroundto colors to set background colors. In this case, we’ll applyboldandred.
Show the number of overdue tasks associated with a project
Tasks remaining
length(Tasks.map(current.Status != "Done"))
length()returns the length of the text or list value. This allows for a count of remaining tasks.
map()returns the list populated with the results of calling the expression on every item in the input list. This looks at the tasks database and pulls in all applicable tasks.
!=is a comparison operator. This allows to pull tasks whose current status is notDone.
Example 2: Project brainstorming
In this example, we’ll use two formulas to brainstorm project ideas, calculate a priority score for each of them, and count the number of upvotes each project receives.

You can explore and play with the formula setups for this example by duplicatingthis pageto your workspace! For another setup that uses the RICE framework, check out thistemplate.
Goal
Property name
Formula
Based off of the scores for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort (RICE), calculate a prioritization score
Score (RICE)
Reach * Impact * Confidence / Effort
When someone clicks the upvote button, count them toward the number of total votes and add their name to the database page
Total votes
length(Upvoted by)
(Advanced) Example 3: Task management automation
In this example, we’ll use some formulas in a databaseautomation(another kind of database property) to make it easier to manage projects and tasks as they’re completed by marking a parent task asDonewhen all its subtasks areDone.
Database automations have triggers and actions that are taken based on those triggers. Formulas allow you to define variables that you can then use in your actions.

You can explore and play with the formula setups for this example by duplicatingthis pageto your workspace!
Goal
How to build it
Functions and built-ins used
Every time a task is set toDone, trigger the automation
Trigger:When status set toDone
-
Define the parent task by finding the first page related to the task that triggered the automation
Action 1:DefineParent taskvariable
Formula:Trigger page.Parent item.first()
Trigger pagereferences the page in the database the automation was triggered from, and.allows you to access properties associated with that page.
Parent itemreturns the contents from that property, which in this case is a list of related pages.
Applying the.first()function on theParent itemproperty returns thefirstrelated page from that list.
If the parent task has subtasks, verify whether all its subtasks have a status ofDone. If the parent task has no subtasks, returnfalse.
Action 2:DefineAll subtasks done?variable
Formula:Parent Task.Sub-item ? Parent Task.Sub-item.every(current.Status == "Done") : false
The ternary operatorX ? Y : Zis a shorthand conditional expression that means:ifthe condition X is true, return Y;otherwise, return Z. It's a concise alternative to anif()statement.
.every()checks whether a condition is true for each item in a list. Within this function, you can use the keywordcurrentto refer to the row being evaluated. In this case, the conditioncurrent.Status == "Done"checks whether the current page’s status property is set toDone. If so, it will returntrue; otherwise it will returnfalse.
If all subtasks areDone, set the parent task’s status toDone. If not, retain the existing status of the parent task.
Action 3:EditStatus​ property
Formula:All subtasks done? ? "Done" : Parent Task.Status​
Again, the ternary operator is used here to see if all subtasks are done. If they are, the automation will set the parent task’s status asDone; if not, it will keep the parent task’s status as is.

SelectEdit formula.
SelectEdit formula.
Edit a formula
Once you’ve created a formula in a database or button, you’ll be able to build and edit that formula in the formula editor, which looks like this:
The field at the top is where you enter and edit your formula. As you write your formula at the top of the editor, the editor will let you know what’s missing, or what the formula expects in order to return a value to you.
The panel on the left side of the edit shows the elements that you can use in the formula — in other words, the properties, built-ins, and functions that are available to you.
The panel on the right side defines formula elements as you hover over them in the left panel. It also gives you examples of how you might use those elements and how they should be structured.
If you open the formula editor from a database row, you'll see a live preview of the result of the formula for that row.

You can also show GitHub activity in the linked Notion task. To do this, click on the GitHub property in your database →Edit property. Turn onActivity Comments.
Use magic words to link GitHub PRs to Notion tasks
If you want to link a GitHub PR to one or more Notion tasks, simply enter a magic word and the Notion tasks’unique IDin your PR’s description.
Magic words are key words that help establish relationships between Notion tasks and GitHub PRs. You can use any of the following words:
close, closes, closed
close, closes, closed
fix, fixes, fixed
fix, fixes, fixed
resolve, resolves, resolved
resolve, resolves, resolved
complete, completes, completed, completing
complete, completes, completed, completing
ref, references
ref, references
part of
part of
related to
related to
contributes to
contributes to
towards
towards
For example, your PR could have the description “fixes CTT-13”. Once that description is set, your Notion task with the ID CTT-13 will be linked with that PR.
If your PR description uses magic words associated with closing or finishing a task, the Notion task will be marked as done when the PR is merged.
If your PR description uses magic words associated with referring to or relating to a task, the Notion task will not be marked as done when the PR is merged.
You can link Notion tasks as reference-only, so that those tasks won’t be marked as done.
Disconnect GitHub from Notion
To disconnect GitHub from Notion, you’ll need to be a Notion workspace owner.
Go toSettings.
Go toSettings.
SelectConnections.
SelectConnections.
Next to GitHub, select•••→Disconnect all users.
Next to GitHub, select•••→Disconnect all users.
When you disconnect GitHub from Notion, nobody in your workspace will be able to use the integration until it’s set up again.

Find answers and generate reports with enterprise search
Finding answers at work should be as simple as using your favorite search engine. With enterprise search, you can quickly find what you need using features like Research mode for in-depth reports and AI connectors that work seamlessly with your current systems.
Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.
Find answers instantly in Notion AI
Navigate your search sources
Pick your preferred source
Pick your preferred model for quick chats or brainstorming
Generate detailed reports with Research mode
Three ways you can use research mode
Search across all your connected tools with AI connectors
Finding information at work should be simple — but it rarely is. Even with modern tools at our fingertips, important knowledge ends up scattered everywhere. Teams waste valuable time digging through docs, emails, and apps just to find what they need.
And when you finally track something down, there's still work to do— you need to turn that information into something useful. Manually connecting all these dots is time-consuming. This is where smart technology can make a real difference. Notion's enterprise search, powered by Notion AI, transforms scattered information into clear, actionable insights and reports—eliminating the need to hunt through different tools for information.
In this guide, you'll learn how to:
Find what you need instantly with our powerful, intuitive search

Find answers instantly in Notion AI
Looking for answers at work should be as simple as using your favorite search engine. That's why we put search front and center in your workspace. Simply head to your Notion homepage, where you'll find a search bar at the top ready to help you find what you need. From here, you can ask, research, or build with Notion AI.
Navigate your search sources
Let's say you're trying to find out what topics were covered in your company's latest All-hands. When you search for this, Notion AI provides an easy-to-digest AI overview along with a breakdown of all the sources it consulted at the top.
Every search result in Notion is thoughtfully organized to help you find what you need. At the top, you'll see simple tabs that group your results by where they come from. For example, if you're looking up All-hands notes, Notion AI will pull in content from both your workspace and Slack channels.
If you want to drill down further, you can filter results by things like title, author, and teamspace. While we put the most helpful results first, keep an eye out for verified pages to make sure you're getting the most reliable info. To learn more about page verification, check outour handy guide.
@ mentions make your searches more powerful

Pick your preferred source
With a dizzying array of information sources, finding answers quickly can be challenging. Sometimes you already know exactly where you want to search. In these cases, you can narrow your results by selecting a specific source. Let's say your UX research team posts customer feedback in a public Slack channel— you can narrow your search to spot those specific insights.
To use the source picker:
Click theSourcesdropdown menu at the bottom left of your search bar
Click theSourcesdropdown menu at the bottom left of your search bar
Select your desired source. In this case, Slack.
Select your desired source. In this case, Slack.
Once you've selected a source, Notion AI pulls information related to the context from that specific source, making your search more focused and relevant.
Pick your preferred model for quick chats or brainstorming
Sometimes you need quick answers that don't require searching through your workspace content. For these cases, Enterprise search gives you the flexibility to choose between different AI models (Notion AI, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Anthropic's Claude) to get faster, more general responses. By skipping the workspace search step, you can get immediate answers to broader questions. You can easily switch between different AI models right from the interface, helping you manage costs as you go. Plus, having everything in one place means you won't need to pay for multiple AI subscriptions, and your team can find information more easily.
Choose the right model for your needs
Click to expand
To select your preferred model, click the model selector in the bottom right corner of your search bar.
Generate detailed reports with Research mode
Notion AI is great at finding exactly what you need— whether that's a specific document, an important conversation, or a key piece of information. Perfect for when you need fast answers, want to brainstorm ideas, or need to check what was discussed in previous meetings.
But sometimes you need to dig deeper. That's where Research mode comes in. It's like having a research analyst on your team, connecting dots across different sources and turning all that information into clear, comprehensive reports— saving you hours of manual work.
Research mode doesn't just look at your workspace— it searches trusted sources across the world wide web too, bringing in current information to make your research better. For example, if you're looking into market trends, Research mode will blend what your team already knows with fresh analysis from reliable sources out there— giving you the full picture you need.
Combining internal and external sources
Click to expand
Three ways you can use research mode
Research mode is particularly valuable when you're tackling complex topics that require thorough investigation and thoughtful synthesis. Let's explore three practical ways Research mode can help you work smarter:
Product Strategy Development—Get a complete picture of your product by bringing together customer feedback, feature requests, and what competitors are doing. Try asking: "What have users said about our payment feature this quarter? Include support tickets, interviews, and competitor insights."

User Research—Make informed design decisions by understanding user needs and best practices. Try asking: "What's new in mobile navigation accessibility? How does our design stack up, and where can we do better?"

When to choose between regular search and research mode

Search across all your connected tools with AI connectors
With AI connectors, you can extend your search across all your favorite tools and apps — not just Notion. This means you won't miss out on important information, no matter where it lives. Think of it as bringing all your work knowledge together in one simple, searchable place.
Here are some ways you can choose AI connectors to expand your search:
Search where your work happens—Connect your tools likeJIRAorGitHubto search through projects, code, and conversations all at once. Need the full story on a feature? Pull in details from JIRA tickets, check out related pull requests, and see all your design files in one search.

Connect your chats to bring everyone up to speed—AI connectors help you search through high-volume chat apps likeSlackand Microsoft Teams. Instead of searching through endless threads for information about a design update, AI connectors instantly surface relevant messages, feedback, and technical notes.

Connect your knowledge hubs—When your team's important documents live across multiple places like Google Drive, OneDrive, and SharePoint, finding what you need can feel like a scavenger hunt. Instead of digging through endless folders to put together a competitor analysis, you can just ask Notion AI to find all your competitor-related files, from reports to presentations to strategy docs.

It transcribes your meeting live, picks up on key decisions and action items, and keeps everything organized.

Use AI connectors to access more of your team’s knowledge
AI connectors let you  find and create content using info from third-party apps (like Slack, JIRA and Google Drive) within Notion. Learn how they can boost your organization's efficiency, enhance overall productivity, and even reduce spend on AI tools.

In an ideal world, your team's knowledge would be neatly organized in one place, regularly updated, and consistently shared across teams. However, for most organizations, this "work about work" often falls to the bottom of the priority list.
Teams are whisked away by a need to respond here, attend a meeting there, and by the end of the day, they’re drained, and vital knowledge remains scattered and disorganized across tools. While AI chatbots offer promises to speed up our work, they both lack crucial company context and exist in a separate digital space, limiting their usefulness.
Notion is the first tool to combine your company’s knowledge — across multiple tools — right alongside the rest of your work.
Search across tools with AI connectors
When you integrate JIRA, Slack or Google Drive with Notion AI, you can ask questions and receive relevant information from these connected sources. Notion AI will provide answers and cite the specific references it used, allowing you to access knowledge across multiple platforms seamlessly.
Notion AI can keep up with Slack discussions, remember every Google Slides presentation, and be accessed with the press of a button — inside Notion, or globally with the shortcutShift + Cmd + J.
Here’s how this might show up in your day-to day work:
Get up-to-date project updates, without a meeting —Try asking Notion AI to “Catch me up on Project Albatross and identify blockers.” It will check your project tracker in Notion, and double-check with your decisions mentioned in Slack — citing its sources so you can jump in wherever needed.

Facilitate better new hire onboarding —New hires have a lot of questions, it’s literally their job to learn! With Notion AI, they can self-serve answers from all of your tools, and therefore trust it’s gathering the full picture. For more inspiration, see how Notion customerdbt Labsused AI to improve teamwork and efficiency.

Access your knowledge from anywhere —The last thing you want to do when you’re on the go is search through multiple apps to find the answer to a simple question — or bug your colleagues when you know you could find it yourself. Notion AI is here to help troubleshoot common issues, wherever you need it.

Everything you have access to — and nothing else
AI connectors respect permissions, so people in your Notion workspace will only see content they already have access to in the connected tools. In other words,it won't reveal anything you're not supposed to see.We've designed this with security in mind, adhering to user permissions both in the original apps and in Notion.
When you ask Notion AI a question it can’t answer, it will let you know, and provide some thought starters using world knowledge.

Transforming your organization with AI connectors
AI connectors are powerful tools that bridge the gap between Notion and your other workplace applications. These connectors allow Notion's AI to access and utilize information from various sources, creating a more comprehensive and efficient workflow. Here's a deeper look at how AI connectors enhance team’s day to day:
Reduce time spent searching—On average, workers spend 3 hours a day* searching for information (*Check out theNotion AI ROI templateto learn more) . This wasted time can hinder productivity and innovation. AI connectors transform Notion into a centralized information hub,saving up to 10 minutes per question asked, enabling teams to make faster, more informed decisions.

This wasted time can hinder productivity and innovation. AI connectors transform Notion into a centralized information hub,saving up to 10 minutes per question asked, enabling teams to make faster, more informed decisions.
Tap in to otherwise unused knowledge—Too often, valuable ideas are buried deep in Slack threads, intended to be shared later but ultimately forgotten to time. Notion AI has the capability to recall that knowledge right when you need it, maximizing the creative impact of your team’s innovation. It can also cite useful information you didn't even know you had (like a new update from your company's all-hands presentation that pairs well with the report you're working on).

Maintain focus and productivity— Context switching between apps can disrupt your workflow and burden you with distracting messages and notifications. With AI seamlessly integrated into Notion, you can access the information you need without breaking your concentration, allowing you to stay in a productive flow state as long as you need.

Consolidate your tool stack—Just like other work software, most AI tools are made up of a set of fundamental actions (we’ve been saying this for years). Notion AI is designed with these building blocks in mind. That means it doesn’tjustallow you to search other tools; but it’s also your team’s chatbot, writing partner, and so much more — so you don’t have to juggle dozens of apps to get work done.

Getting started with connected tools
Getting started with AI Connector for JIRA
JIRA is a powerful tool for project tracking that many technical teams rely on. Byintegrating JIRA with Notion, you create a seamless workspace where your project management tools work together. This gives everyone—especially those who aren't JIRA experts—a clear, accessible overview of what's happening. The AI Connector for JIRA lets you access your JIRA information right within Notion, so you can find what you need without switching between tools.
Here's just a few ways you can use the JIRA connector in your workflows:
Generate project reports and status updates —Pull together quick project snapshots for meetings by asking "What's the status of the website redesign project?". Notion AI will gather information on deadlines, blockers, and progress from multiple tickets, helping teams stay aligned without the manual work.

Get insights into who is working on what —Ask Notion AI to show what your teammates are tackling in JIRA. Questions like "Show me what Alex is working on" or "Who's fixing the payment bug?" help you gather info for meetings without missing a beat. Everyone gets clear visibility into workloads— no JIRA access needed.

Getting started with AI Connector for Slack
We sometimes say Slack is like the other half of Notion. If all of your permanent docs live inside Notion, then all of your ephemeral conversations happen in Slack. By connecting Slack to Notion, you can bridge the gap between these two crucial communication channels. This integration allows you to seamlessly search and reference Slack conversations directly within Notion, ensuring that no important information slips through the cracks.
Here’s just a few ways we see the Slack connector show up in teams’ workflows:
Write smarter status reports—Project managers responsible for writing a daily or weekly status report will appreciate the ability to ask Notion AI to note everything that’s happened in a certain time period.

Getting started with AI Connector for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides
Google Drive is a vital hub for many teams, housing essential documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. By connecting it to Notion, you're bringing this wealth of information directly into your workflow.
With the Google Drive connector, Notion AI can quickly reference key data from Google Documents, Slides or Sheets without switching apps or even compile research from various Google Docs into your Notion projects.
Here’s just a few ways we see the Google Drive connector show up in teams’ workflows:
Bring formal messaging into your docs—Your teams may work in Notion, but you likely have a slide library elsewhere with your formal pitches, all-hands presentations, and more. This form of information sharing can be really helpful to individuals trying to succinctly capture and share context ahead of a project.

This form of information sharing can be really helpful to individuals trying to succinctly capture and share context ahead of a project.
Access legacy knowledge—If you’ve largely switched off of google docs but haven’t imported everything over to Notion, an AI connector can help bridge the gap. This way, you have access to the information you need, but only when you need it.

Improve sharing across teams—Some teams' work requires them to stay in other tools. For instance, your legal team might work primarily in Google Docs for contract drafting. The Google Drive connector allows other teams to easily reference key terms in Notion without disrupting the legal team's workflow, ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.

Getting Started with AI Connector for Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive
Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint are essential tools for team collaboration - from team chats and meetings to file storage and document management. By connecting these tools to Notion, you can seamlessly access your conversations and files right within your Notion workspace, making it easier to find and use the content you need.
With the AI connector for Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint, Notion AI can quickly reference key data from your team conversations, personal files, and shared documents all in one place.
To get started, head to the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of your Notion AI chat and connect your Microsoft tool of choice.
Here are a few ways we see the Microsoft connector showing up in teams' workflows:
Smarter meetings—Turn your Teams meetings into action items in seconds. With the Microsoft AI connector, Notion can find key decisions in your meeting transcripts across standard, private (1:1 and group chats), and shared channels. It helps you draft follow-up tasks — all right in your Notion pages. No more digging through recordings to remember what was decided.

With Notion AI, everyone can stay up to date without disrupting each other's work. For example, your sales team can quickly check the latest product updates from engineering's SharePoint docs, right in Notion.

HIPAA configuration
Learn about how to make your Notion workspace HIPAA compliant, and how to enable HIPAA compliance 🏥
Configuring Notion for HIPAA
Enable HIPAA compliance
Deactivate HIPAA compliance
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that was enacted in 1996 that requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates.
This article provides users required product configurations to make their Notion workspace HIPAA compliant.

Note:Notion's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) governs the protection of Personal Health Information (PHI) that is stored in the Notion Service. To be eligible to sign Notion’s BAA, you must subscribe to our Enterprise Plan.
Notion Calendar, any Notion Calendar features, and any Beta Services are not covered by the BAA and therefore may not be used or deployed in a manner that processes protected health information.
To the extent that any language on this page and language found in the BAA conflict at any time, the BAA shall control.

Access Control
Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.
Notion’s SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.
To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:
Verify domain(s):To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain’s DNS to verify your ownership of it.
Enable SAML SSO:This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer tothis article.
Change default login method:Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.
Link additional workspaces:If you have more than one workspace you’d like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to[email protected].
Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there’s an IdP/SAML SSO failure.

FAQs
Why do I see duplicate tasks in My tasks?
If you’re seeing tasks that look the same in My tasks, it’s possible that you have multiple tasks with the same name across different Task databases. Check the URLs or databases that your tasks belong to, then consolidate any duplicates. To avoid any confusion in the future, you can consider having a different naming convention for different Task databases!

FAQs
Which versions of Confluence are supported?
We officially support importing from Confluence Cloud, in pages created using the new editor that Confluence introduced in late 2018.
Due to insufficient data in its index export, we do not support importing from Confluence Server.
For help importing an entire workspace from the legacy editor, please contact support at[email protected].
Do imported blocks count towards the storage limit for Free Plan workspaces with multiple members?
No, imported blocks will not count towards the limit. However, any blocks subsequently created inside imported pages will count towards the limit as usual.

Is there a maximum import size for Confluence imports?
Confluence imports are limited to 5GB for zip-file imports and 30 GB for API imports.
If you run into the limit, you can try using theCustom Exportoption to select pages for export, omitting attachment-heavy pages.
When I try to import from Confluence, I can't choose my file in the file upload window.
Please make sure to upload a.zipfile created by the Confluence space export functionality. Word documents and standalone HTML files will not work, since Notion relies on the whole import to preserve structure and links between pages.
I can't find the option to export my Confluence workspace.
If the "Export" tab does not appear in the Content Tools section of a workspace's settings, you may not have the appropriate permissions to export pages. Ask the workspace administrator for permission.
I can't seem to import from Evernote China/Evernote Business.
Unfortunately, our importer only supports the standard edition of Evernote at the moment. We're working on it!

Intro to databases
Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃

Databases are one of Notion’s fundamental features. They help you manage and organize multiple pages in one place. Notion databases are unique because:
Every item is its own page:Every item you enter into your database is a Notion page. Open a database item to add more information in the form of text, images, and more, as you would with any other Notion page!

Create a database
To create a database in Notion, create a new page and underGet started with, selectTable. You can also open an existing page and use the slash command/database.
When you create a database, you can start from scratch or pull in data from another part of your workspace. If you want to create a database that’s a variation of another database that exists in your workspace, we suggest selecting an existing data source. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.
Need inspiration or help getting started? Creating a new database will also give you the option toBuild with AIand give Notion AI a prompt to use to build you a database. You’ll also be able to choose from aSuggestedtemplate.
Let’s walk through some of the first steps you can take to set up a new database.
Create a new database page:ClickNew pageto add a new page to your database. For example, if your database is a task tracker, your first page might be the first task you want to track.

Edit your view: For each view, you can edit its name, its layout, the properties that are shown or hidden in it, and more. You can also filter, sort, and group the items in your database. For example, you might want to see a task requestor in one view but not in another.

Add and open database pages
Every item in your database, whether it's a row in a table or a card on a board or calendar, is its own Notion page that you can build, format, and nest content in like any other page.

Note:When a database contains more than 1,000 items, new pages may appear in the middle of the collection instead of at the end. This is due to the way large collections are sorted and indexed.
To add database items:
For all databases: Click the blueNewbutton at the top right.

Collaborating in a database
When using a database in a shared workspace, Notion has features in place to prevent accidental edits that could impact other teammates.
"Can edit content" permission level
ClickShareat the top of a database to see and manage all users' permission levels.Learn more about sharing and permissions here →
TheCan edit contentpermission level is only found on database pages, and allows users to:
Create, edit, and delete pages within the database.

Note:Users withCan edit contentaccess will still be able to create linked databases and edit views, sorts, and filters in that linked database.Learn more about linked databases →
Lock views
Find this option in the•••menu at the very top right of the Notion window. Switch it on to prevent anyone from changing properties and views in your database. They'll still be able to edit the data it contains.
Note that anyone with editing access can toggle this lock on or off at any time. This is helpful as a quick safeguard against accidental edits in a database that you'd like many people to be able to change structurally.

Team vs. personal workspaces
A workspace operates slightly differently if you're using it with a team than if you're using it on your own:
In personal workspaces, newly created pages will be private by default unless they're explicitly shared.

FAQs
Can I switch between workspaces that are associated with different email addresses?
To add your workspaces from another email account, use theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.More on this here →

I clicked the Create or Join Workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
You can only join a workspace via theCreate or Join Workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled, which lets users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
To join a workspace, you'll need to ask an admin from that workspace to send you an invite.

My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, aTeamspacessection appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and thePrivatesection is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.

When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?
Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?
Note:Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information,click here.
To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click•••next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and selectMove to.At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in thePrivatesection but can be moved wherever you want to put them.

What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back?
If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking?at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us at[email protected].
We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.
How do I log out of my Notion account?
Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option toLog outnext to your email address.

Troubleshooting
Notion’s integration with Jira allows you to do a few different things. You can insert Jira links into Notion pages to quickly access or preview them, or you can sync your Jira projects and issues to Notion databases so you can track all of your work in one place. Read on to learn about the different forms of the integration and how you can set them up.
Jira integration differences
Notion offers two Jira integrations:JiraandJira Sync. Think of them as the lightweight and full-featured options.
If you only need to sync a single Jira project with a Notion database once—and don’t plan to set up additional syncs—thelegacy synced databasethrough the Jira integration might be enough. Just keep in mind: it uses user tokens, which tend to be less reliable than the admin tokens used by Jira Sync.
For ongoing, flexible syncing across multiple projects and databases,Jira Syncis the newer, more powerful option. Just note: it requires a Jira admin to set up.

Note:There’s no one-click migration from the legacy Jira integration to Jira Sync. They are separate integrations, so setting up the new Jira Sync will require a full reinstallation.

Jira Sync
The Jira Sync integration connects your Jira projects to Notion using an Admin API token (rather than a user token), providing a more consistent and centralized syncing experience.
To ensure reliable syncing, we recommend creating a scopeless token by selectingCreate API token, notCreate API token with scopes.
Now you can take full advantage of Notion's features includingautomations,rollups, andNotion AI. Use Notion AI to quickly answer questions about your Jira projects.

Note:
A workspace owner must set up Jira Sync first, then all members can use it.

Jira Sync displays your Jira projects and issues as Notion projects and issues databases. This setup allows you to see and track multiple projects using a variety of helpfulviews, filters, and sorts.
You can even use identity mapping to connect Jira identities to Notion profiles so that you can see who’s responsible for what in synced Notion databases.

🟡 Note:Onlyworkspace owners can set up Jira Sync, by using aJira Admin token. After that, any member can utilize the connection.

How Jira Sync works
After the initial import, your Jira-synced projects is kept up to date in two ways:
Webhooks:Updates made in Jira are sent to Notion in real time through webhooks.These changes usually appear within minutes, but occasional delays or missed updates may occur due to network or system issues.The webhook setup is done automatically when the sync is first established.

As an example, thefield typein Jira must be set as a date field for the data to translate correctly in Notion and display as a date.
Projects database
Your Jira projects will be synced into a Notion projects database. Your projects will be intelligently mapped to their corresponding Jira issues in a related, synced issues database in Notion. This database will come with pre-populated default database views to help you get started more quickly:
Active (table view): This view shows the projects you’ve synced whose status is in progress. In other words, this view doesn’t show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.

While Notion doesn't support certain Jira custom properties, it does support all Jira primitive custom properties, such as string, number, select, person, and date.
Sync duration and limitations
It should only take a few minutes for the initial sync to complete, but depending on the size of your Jira projects and issues, this could take up to a few hours.

Reconnect your synced database
If your webhook registration has failed, or your project sync has failed, you’ll seeSync failedat the top of the database. To solve this issue, try the sync again with a different set of projects. You can also ensure that your projects don’t have any issues in Jira.
If your Jira token is no longer valid or someone has disconnected Jira from Notion, you’ll seeSync stoppedat the top of the database. To solve this issue, selectRe-authenticatenext toSync stopped. You must be a workspace owner to complete this process.
Once your Jira instance is reconnected with Notion, your projects and issues databases won’t be recreated; instead, you’ll continue to use the projects and issues databases you had before.

Troubleshooting
Jira dates may be interpreted differently in Notion, appearing one day earlier or later than expected. This is because Jira does not provide timezone information for date fields.

Layouts let you customize the way properties are organized in your database pages. With layouts, you can make pages in one database look distinct from pages in another database, depending on their use. For example, pages in your database for weekly marketing reports can be built to look very different from your database for team tasks.
Layouts also help you keep your database pages clean and easy to navigate, especially when you’re working with lots of properties. You can bring certain properties to the forefront while keeping others out of sight, all depending on what’s most important to you and your team.

Note:
To build a database page layout, you must have at leastCan editaccess to the database.

Managed users
As an enterprise workspace owner, you have many ways you can manage the users within your domain, including a dashboard where you can get information and make changes 👥
Managing user accounts
Managed users dashboard

Note:This feature is only available to users on the Enterprise Plan with at least oneverified domain.

Enterprise workspace owners have the ability to manage all the users within their organization. A managed user is any user with an account created with the organization's verified email domain.
There are many ways in which workspace owners can manage users with their domain. To access these settings, go toSettings→Identity.
Managing user accounts
Workspace owners can use these settings to apply more granularity to how their managed users work in Notion.
Allow users to change account information: Let users change their preferred name, email address, and profile photo.

Managed users dashboard
Enterprise workspace owners have access to a handy dashboard that gives them an overview of all users in their verified domain.
In this dashboard, workspace owners can:
Search and filter all users using the workspace's verified domains

The dashboard displays user details such as name, email address, a list of workspaces they have access to, last active date, and the state of their 2-step authentication.
To access the managed users dashboard:
Click onSettingsand navigate toIdentity & provisioning.
Click onSettingsand navigate toIdentity & provisioning.
UnderUser management, findManaged users dashboardand clickView dashboard.
UnderUser management, findManaged users dashboardand clickView dashboard.
From this dashboard, workspace owners can search for users by name, email, or ID. Additionally, they can filter by workspace and 2-step verification method.

Note:Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of.
All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette.
On a specific user's profile, workspace owners can:
Suspend the user

FAQs
Will changes to managed user accounts made by the workspace admins be tracked?
Yes, all changes made by a workspace owner to a managed user’s account will be logged in the audit log.
If a password is reset or a user is removed from a workspace, they will receive an email notification.
Will users in my workspace know that their account is being managed by the workspace admin?
Yes, users will see a badge when they go toSettings→{their name}.
If my workspace is using SCIM, can I still make changes to managed user accounts through Notion?
Updating managed user profile information from this new dashboard isnot recommendedif the Enterprise workspace is using the SCIM API directly or through an Identity Provider (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) to programmatically manage workspace members.
If the workspace is using SCIM, then changes made from the Notion Settings UI will be replaced when the next SCIM API request syncs up.
My workspace has verified several domains. Will I see all managed users for all of our domains together in the dashboard?
Yes, you will see all your managed users (from multiple verified domains) together in the dashboard.
What happens if a user is suspended?
Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of.
All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette.
Other users can still share pages with the suspended user, @-mention them, and add them to workspaces or teamspaces. The suspended users won’t be able login, receive any notifications, or access any of these resources. They’ll see them if/when they’re unsuspended.
What happens if a user is deleted?
All public or shared content created by the deleted user remains, but attributions and @-mentions change toDeleted User.
Any private or shared pages where no remaining users have full access will be deleted. Deletions are permanent, with a 30-day grace period to cancel and restore.
If the account may be needed in the future, it is recommended to suspend instead of delete. Deleted users do not contribute to the billable seat count of the workspace.

Add a math equation inline
Just like you can format text in Notion asbold, strikethrough, orcode notation, you can also format your text as a math equation, like this quadratic formula:
There are a few different ways to add math equations inline, and all are keyboard friendly.
With text shortcuts:
Type two dollar signs, followed by your equation. When you close your formula with two more dollar signs, it will turn into an equation.

Recognized symbols
Notion supports the full scope of symbols and operations within the \KaTeX language. For a full list of supported functions, please visit the links below:
Supported Functions · KaTeX

Note:KaTeX spans most, but not all mathematical notation supported by LaTeX. If your equation isn't rendering correctly in Notion, please visit the links above to see if that function is supported.

FAQs
I don't know LaTeX but want to use Notion's equations. How can I get started?
It's easy to get started using LaTeX for homework, class notes, or lab reports. Basic arithmetic and variable names are valid in LaTeX already.
If you just need to look up specific symbols,Detexifyis a great resource that allows you to draw the symbol and look up the corresponding LaTeX code.
To learn more powerful LaTeX, Overleafdocumentationis a great place to learn the basics:
Mathematical expressions

Subscripts and superscripts

Note that Overleaf is a full-featured LaTeX editor, so not everything in the documentation is supported in Notion. If in doubt, you can always check this list ofSupported Functionsor alphabetizedSupport Tableto determine which functions are supported.
Why can't I render a specific equation? What formulas/libraries do you support? Can you add support for a formula or library I want to use?
Notion uses theKaTeXlibrary to render equations. KaTeX supports a large subset of LaTeX, documented on their list ofSupported Functionsand alphabetized in thisSupport Table. To request support for new functions or environments, you can open an issue on theKaTeX GitHub project.
I'm trying to use the align environment and it's not working!
From theCommon Issuespage of the KaTeX documentation:
"KaTeX does not support thealignenvironment because LaTeX doesn't supportalignin math mode. Thealignedenvironment offers the same functionality but in math mode, so use that instead."
Can I use inline equations for superscript and subscript?
It's possible to use inline equations for superscript and subscript, but it does mean that the text will be an equation, in "equation font."
Use^to designate superscript, for example:x^2
Use^to designate superscript, for example:x^2
Use_to designate subscript, for example:H_2O
Use_to designate subscript, for example:H_2O
If there are multiple characters that you want to include in superscript or subscript, wrap them in curly brackets. For example:23^{rd}

What happens when I copy/paste inline LaTeX?
It will give you the source code.
How do I use Notion for chemistry?
Notion supports the\\ceand\\puchemical equation macros from themhchemextension. These shortcuts allow you to typeset beautiful chemical and mathematical equations quickly and easily.
How do I convert between inline and block equations?
If you have a block containing an inline equation, you can use the "Turn into" menu to make it a block equation.

How adding & removing members impacts billing
Notion’s billing model looks at the number of members in your workspace. Learn how adding or removing members can impact your billing 👤
Members vs. guests
Adding members to your workspace
On a monthly plan
On a yearly plan
Removing members from a workspace
Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.
Members vs. guests
Before you add someone to your workspace as a member, remember thatadding members to a paid Notion workspace is a billable action and will incur additional charges on your invoice.
If you don’t want to add a new member to your workspace but would like to collaborate with people via Notion, you can invitegueststo specific Notionpagesinstead, provided you haven’t metyour plan’s guest limit. Guests get access at the page level and are more limited in what they can do in a Notion workspace. Learn more about members and guestshere →
To avoid accidentally adding members to your workspace, go to the Notion page you want to invite a guest to, selectShareat the top of that page, and after you enter their email address, hover over their email address to confirm that they’re being added as a guest before you selectInvite.
You’ll be asked if you’d like to upgrade the guest to a member — selectSkip for nowto ensure that they’ll be added to that page at no cost.
Adding members to your workspace
On a monthly plan
When you add members to your workspace on a monthly plan, you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.
On a yearly plan
When you add members to your workspace on a yearly plan, you'll receive an invoice at thenext monthmark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:
The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.
The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.
Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.
Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.
Removing members from a workspace
When you remove members from your workspace,you have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your current billing interval. You can add new members before the end of your current billing interval to fill these seats at no additional charge.
At the end of your billing interval, we’ll recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.

Every teamspace in Notion gets one project and one task database per import, so if you have multiple projects within one teamspace, all of those projects will go into the same database, unless imported in batches. As a workaround, you can import any additional projects into a separate teamspace and move them manually afterwards, or import your account in batches so that you can bring more projects and task databases to the same teamspaces each time.

FAQs
How do I log out of my Notion account?
Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option toLog outnext to your email address.

My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, aTeamspacessection appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and thePrivatesection is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.

Can I rename the sidebar sections or add my own custom sections?
Not at the moment, unfortunately 😓 If your sidebar is feeling cluttered, you can always consolidate some of your pages under more top-level pages.

Create & manage workspaces
When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘

How it works
Approve workspaces for your network
With this feature, Workspace Owners can manage which Notion workspaces are accessible on their corporate network using their proxy or cloud access security broker (CASB) solution.
If you're a Workspace Owner, this article will show you how to approve Notion workspaces using an SSL proxy within your corporate network. By restricting connections, you can prevent users on your network from signing in to unauthorized workspaces.
How it works
Workspace Owner can configure an on-premises or cloud-based proxy server to intercept traffic tonotion.so. The proxy inserts a new HTTP header (X-Notion-Allowed-Workspaces) that lists the workspaces your employees can access.
Once enabled:
Your team will be able to access the approved workspace(s) and continue using Notion normally.
Your team will be able to access the approved workspace(s) and continue using Notion normally.
If anyone tries to sign in to a workspace that isn't on the approved list, they'll see an error message.If a user has an active session and joins a corporate network, they will see an error message.

Organize information with databases
← Notion Academy
Organize information with databases
Databases are a powerful Notion feature that can unlock your toolmaking potential. Create databases, learn about layout types, and build databases for teams.
Intro to databases
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, discuss the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃
Using database views
Here, we'll introduce you to the different customization options and layouts that exist once you have a database set up in your workspace.
Timeline view
Timeline is a type of Notion database that’s way more than a Gantt chart. It gives you complete flexibility to scope projects, adjust their timelines, and customize your workflow.
Table view
Tables are Notion's most traditional database view, but our tables are a lot more powerful than a grid with some rows and columns! Open each row as its own Notion page, or visualize in other database views.
Gallery view
Galleries are Notion's most visual database view. Use them to showcase beautiful photos for mood boards, team directories, vacation photos and more.
List view
Lists are Notion's most minimalist database view. All the power of a database, but without the visual clutter. Use them for meeting notes, journal entries, process documentation and more!
Board view
One of Notion's most powerful features, Boards are the best way to manage projects & tasks. Use them to group your databases by select, multiselect, and person properties.
Calendar view
Calendars are a great way to visualize dates from any database in Notion. Use them for your company's social media planning, or add a calendar view to your product management databases.
Using database templates
Instead of manually typing out the same structure and content for every new page, you can use database templates to automate your processes and save some time.
Using linked databases
Linked databases let you include synced copies of the same content across different pages. Use them to include a filtered view of team tasks in your meeting notes, or create a dashboard of tasks assigned to you from different databases.
Using advanced database filters
Managing tasks and projects in Notion just got a big upgrade. With new advanced database filters, you have even more control and customizability over your database views - make them as specific as you want for a more organized and efficient workflow.
Relation and rollup properties
Notion databases become even more powerful when you link them together. Link to a row from another database with a relation, or show a specific property from a related table with a rollup.
Notion for people ops
Explain how Notion can keep teams on the same page and be able to set up Notion for large teams using teamspaces.

Shared drives: In Notion, an admin will have the option to omit specific shared drives in Settings.
User groups and organizational units: For granular permissions, the admin has the option to select specific user groups or organizational units in the Google Admin Workspace. For any user groups or organizational units that are deselected, Notion will not ingest any files that are owned by this audience and this audience will not be able to use the feature in Notion.

For any user groups or organizational units that are deselected, Notion will not ingest any files that are owned by this audience and this audience will not be able to use the feature in Notion.
Why can’t I see a certain Google Drive file?
It’s possible for a file to only be accessible if you have the direct link. If you’ve visited the file at least once before, you should be able to search that specific file.
I connected the wrong Notion workspace. How can I disconnect my Google Drive Workspace from my Notion workspace?
To disconnect your Google Drive Workspace, go toSettings→Notion AI. Select⚙️next toGoogle Drive→Settings→Disconnect.
How do the permission settings work?
All permissions in a Google document will be respected for individual users and general access types listed below:
Restricted: Only users who have been directly added to the document will have access
Restricted: Only users who have been directly added to the document will have access
{Company Name}: Anyone in the company can access the document as long as any user in the workspace has visited the page. In the document, the access level should be set toCan find in search resultsand notMust have link to access, which is the default setting.
{Company Name}: Anyone in the company can access the document as long as any user in the workspace has visited the page. In the document, the access level should be set toCan find in search resultsand notMust have link to access, which is the default setting.
Anyone with link: Anyone in the company can access the documentif they have visited the document at least once.
Anyone with link: Anyone in the company can access the documentif they have visited the document at least once.

Note:Target audiencesare not supported(for example, 20 individual users added to a target audience namedSales team).Even if a file has been shared with a target audience, it’ll only be searchable for people who have access to the file directly or via a group.
How long does it take for the integration to complete?
Upon initial connection, it will take the integration approximately 36 hours to sync. Once the integration syncs, you can expect real-time updates to your Google Drive to be reflected in Notion AI on an ongoing basis.
How long does it take for new content to appear?
New content added to Google documents will update every hour and will be available in searches then in Notion AI.
Will all future content or shared/user drives be available?
Yes. Anytime your organization sets up up a new shared or user-level drive, it will be synced to Notion AI. You can edit this option in your settings.
Can I edit the connection after set up?
You can edit your connection by going toSettings→Notion AI. Select⚙️next toGoogle Drive.
Can I add connect multiple Notion workspaces to my Google Workspace?
Not at this time. The workspace admin will only be able to connect one Notion workspace to one Google Workspace.
Does Notion AI respect Google Drive permissions?
Absolutely. Notion AI will honor existing permissions according to our existingNotion AI Security Practices. Users will not be able to generate content or receive responses based on resources they do not have access to. Specific to third party content, Notion AI is handling both private and public content with security in mind, only ingesting content according to the permissions mapping between Google Drive and Notion users.
How do shared drives work?
To connect a shared drive to Notion AI:
The drive must live inside your Google Workspace.
The drive must live inside your Google Workspace.
Shared drives must be included during initial setup.
Shared drives must be included during initial setup.
At least one owner of the shared driver must be selected among the users and groups.
At least one owner of the shared driver must be selected among the users and groups.
At least one user selected in the user groups must be a contributor, content manager, or manager for the shared drive.
At least one user selected in the user groups must be a contributor, content manager, or manager for the shared drive.
We will respect the permission settings of the drive (if the shared drive was directly shared with you) or the file (if the file has been shared directly with you or with a group that you are a part of).
How does Notion store or reference my Google Drive data in its systems?
Similar to our core Notion AI product, we store create and store embeddings in a vector database hosted by Turbopuffer, which powers the ability to provide responses to questions that leverage third party content (like in Google Drive). Turbopuffer has been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification.Learn more about Turbopuffer’s security here →
Which account should I use to initiate the connection for Google Drive in Notion?
Whichever account is used to initiate connection will be stored in the Notion system as a customer admin email, and we will use this admin email for future updates, so it's important for customers to provide an email that won't change in terms of permissions or active status so that service isn't impacted when, for example, an admin leaves the company. You can use any service email that has admin privileges to your Google Workspace and will remain the same, like[email protected].

Do you support Slack Enterprise Grid?
Yes, we do! Please reach out to your sales representative to get started.
How long does it take for the integration to complete for public channels?
Once the integration is set up, it will be able to find messages going back a year from when the setup is complete. For example, if you connect Slack with Notion AI on June 1, 2024, Notion AI will be able to find information from messages in Slack sent on June 1, 2023 and later. Depending on the amount of content shared in your public channels during this time frame, this process can take up to 36 hours.
How long does it take for Notion AI to read new Slack messages?
New messages in public channels may take 30 minutes to be searchable by Notion AI.
If I connect Slack to Notion AI, does Notion AI automatically begin searching all of my Slack channels?
No. Notion AI only searches public Slack channels, and during initial setup, our configuration options allow you to choose either a discrete set of public channels or all public channels in your workspace to be included. Additionally, you have the option to continuously include all public channels that are created after initial setup. This configuration requires approvals via the Notion workspace owner and the Slack admin.
Who can access Slack content using Notion AI?
Individuals who are both a Slack and a Notion workspace member can use this integration. Notion AI maps Slack members to Notion members, so individuals must be authenticated at the user level for its use. Through account mapping and real-time event subscriptions, Notion conducts ongoing checks for changes to permissions and access levels that would impact the Slack content surfaced in Notion AI for each individual.This integration is not available for guests in your Notion workspace, or guests in your Slack workspace (like people external to your organization that you may communicate with using Slack Connect).
Here are a few examples of permissions-related scenarios that Notion proactively checks and updates for:
When users edit or delete a message in Slack, Notion AI monitors for modified or deleted content via webhooks and will reflect these updates in near real-time.
When users edit or delete a message in Slack, Notion AI monitors for modified or deleted content via webhooks and will reflect these updates in near real-time.
Slack or Notion guest users are not allowed to leverage Notion AI at all. In the case where a guest user is given full Slack workspace member and full Notion workspace member permissions, Notion AI monitor for membership changes and updates those permissions changes in near-real time.
Slack or Notion guest users are not allowed to leverage Notion AI at all. In the case where a guest user is given full Slack workspace member and full Notion workspace member permissions, Notion AI monitor for membership changes and updates those permissions changes in near-real time.
When a user is deactivated in Slack, Notion AI monitors permissions and updates that permission change within approximately 30 minutes.
When a user is deactivated in Slack, Notion AI monitors permissions and updates that permission change within approximately 30 minutes.
I have Slack Connect channels set up with external users. Will these channels be indexed?
No. All external messages and channels will be excluded.
How does Notion store or reference my Slack data in its systems?
Slack content is stored as embeddings using vector databases like Turbopuffer. These embeddings allow for efficient searches and comparisons across different pieces of text to provide accurate and relevant responses to your questions.
Notion’s vector databases have been vetted by our Security team as well as by an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification. Seethis articlefor more information.
How much of my Slack data will be ingested for Notion AI?
Once the integration is set up, it will be able to find messages going back a year from when the setup is complete. For example, if you connect Slack with Notion AI on June 1, 2024, Notion AI will be able to find information from messages in Slack sent on June 1, 2023 and later. The feature will also continue to ingest any new messages added to your Slack environment (in either your selected channels or all public channels) after initial configuration to be used for responses to search queries.
Why does the “This app is not approved by Slack” banner appear?
Users will see aThis app is not approved by Slackbanner because Slack does not approve apps that enable certain types of search functionality, like searching Slack content externally, making formal approval for Notion AI unlikely.
However, the integration is secure, follows Slack’s policies, and is commonly connected directly through Notion. The lack of approval is a policy limitation, not a security issue. Notion AI only accesses data users are authorized to see, stores it securely in a SOC2 Type II environment, and does not use customer data to train AI models.
I connected the wrong Notion workspace. How can I disconnect my Slack workspace from Notion?
To disconnect your Slack workspace, go toSettings→Notion AI. Select⚙️next toSlack→Settings→Disconnect.
What happens to my Slack data if I connect to Notion AI and then decide to disconnect?
Notion treats your Slack content with the privacy principle of data minimization in mind. If you decide to disconnect your Slack environment from Notion AI, your Slack content will immediately become unsearchable, and your Slack data used for Notion AI will be deleted in less than one day from when the request is made.

Notion AI appears seamlessly in your workspace but leverages technology from several AI Subprocessors to provide you with the service. Check out ourSubprocessor Pagefor a complete list of our current Subprocessors, and learn more about Notion AIhere →
How does Notion AI work?
Who are Notion’s Large Language Model Providers?
Notion currently utilizes various large language models (LLMs) hosted by Notion as well as by organizations such as Anthropic and OpenAI. We continuously evaluate LLM providers and their models to provide the highest quality experience to our Notion AI users. Any third parties that process Customer Data will be published in ourSubprocessor Page.
How do I subscribe to new Subprocessor notifications?
Customers may sign up to receive notification of new Subprocessors by emailing[email protected]with the subject “Subscribe to New Subprocessors.” Once a customer has signed up to receive new Subprocessor notifications, Notion will provide that customer with notice of any new Subprocessors before authorizing the new Subprocessor to process Customer Data. For additional information, please see ourData Processing Addendum.
How does Notion AI use content from a workspace?
Notion AI is able to reference content from your workspace through two key phases:
Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).
Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).
Generating responses informed by the content in your workspace.
Generating responses informed by the content in your workspace.
What are embeddings?
Embeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. For Notion AI, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.
Here is an example of an embedding fromOpenAI:
[-0.02541878,-0.0104167685,-0.0015037002,...,-0.004155378,-0.00043069973,-0.01679479]
How are embeddings created?
For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.
For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.
Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Turbopuffer). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request.
Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Turbopuffer). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request.
How are embeddings protected?
Despite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreement (DPA) apply to embeddings. View ourTerms and Privacy Pagefor more information.
We store embeddings with vector databases like Turbopuffer. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC 2 Type 2 certification.
How are responses generated?
Notion receives a request from a user.
Notion receives a request from a user.
The request is passed to LLMs and AI Models. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, a response is generated at this point and returned. If the user’s request requires searching their workspace, LLMs and AI Models generate a search query most relevant for the user request.

How is my data protected?
Does Notion AI respect existing permissions?
Yes, Notion AI honors existing permissions. The LLMs and AI Models used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.
How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?
Notion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.
Prior to engaging any third-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notion’s security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessor’s criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.
When we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in-transit using TLS 1.2 or greater.
For more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to ourData Processing Addendum.
Will my data be used to train any models?
By default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.
Your use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.
How is Customer Data segregated?
Individual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.
What are the data retention obligations of third-party AI providers?
Notion AISubprocessorshave data retention policies that allow Notion to meetour obligations to customers for the processing of data.
When using Notion AI, our LLM providers utilize zero data retention for Enterprise plan workspaces, so no data is stored with LLM providers. For all non-Enterprise plan workspaces, LLM providers only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion. Notion AI is additionally powered by OpenAI's embeddings. OpenAI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.
Embeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.
If a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer tothis article.
What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?
Notion AI is included in the scope of Notion’s SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.
Notion AI enables HIPAA compliance by utilizing LLM provider’s zero-retention APIs and allows for the processing of protected health information (PHI).
What controls can be added?
Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?
Customers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third-party integration partners on our Enterprise Plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrationshere.
What are the legal considerations?
Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?
TheNotion AI Supplementary Termsapply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, Notion’sContent & Use Policyapplies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.
Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?
Notion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in theNotion AI Supplementary Termsin the "Input and Output" section:
You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (“Input”), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (“Output”). When you use Notion AI, Input and Output are your Customer Data.
You can also reference our standarddata protection practices.

Conferencing integrations

For the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web.
Notion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:
Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.
Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.
Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.

Set a default conferencing option
A default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you’re using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go toSettings→Conferencing→Default conferencing, then in the dropdown, selectZoom.
Zoom
Connect your Zoom account
To connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go toSettings→Conferencing. FindZoomand selectConfigure. When you’re redirected to your browser, make sure you’re logged in with the right Zoom account, then selectAuthorizeto give Notion Calendar access.
Notion Calendar asks only for theZoom permissionsthat we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events.Learn more about our security practices here →
Passcode settings
If you’ve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in yourZoom Profile Settings, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin'spasscode complexity requirements.
Disconnect your Zoom account
To stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go toSettings→Conferencing. Find Zoom and selectDisconnect.
If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom'sdeauthorization and data complianceguidelines.

Note:
If you’re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign intomarketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn onPre-approve.
If you’re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign intomarketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn onPre-approve.

If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.
If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.

Google Meet
Because Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don’t need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you’ve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you’re joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.

Note:If you don’t see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn’t have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin toturn on Meet video calling.

Notion integration
Notion Calendar can be used with Notion. Add Notion pages to your event details for easy access and view important dates from Notion databases directly in Notion Calendar so you don’t have to track your database events separately from your other important plans.Learn more here →

Optimize database load times & performance
Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼
Things that can slow your database down
Things you can do to speed up your database setup
Avoid building too many databases into high-traffic pages
Avoid complex reference chains
Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups
Filter on simple properties
Hide unnecessary properties
Delete any unused pages
We’re always working to improve your experience with Notion, and we appreciate your feedback and patience. If your databases aren’t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.
Things that can slow your database down
Number of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.
Number of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.
Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.
Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.
Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.
Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.
Things you can do to speed up your database setup
Avoid building too many databases into high-traffic pages
If you have a large workspace, avoid having lots ofinline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.
Try housing each database in its own page first. Once you’ve done that, if you’d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:
Type/linkedin that page and selectLinked view of a databaseto create alinked database.
Type/linkedin that page and selectLinked view of a databaseto create alinked database.
Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!
Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!
When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.
Avoid complex reference chains
Formulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.
Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups
Databases that arefiltered and sortedonformulaandrollupproperties may take a bit longer to load.
Filter on simple properties
Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.
Hide unnecessary properties
If some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.
Delete any unused pages
We suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If that’s not an option for you, adding a filter on theCreated timeproperty to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.

Table view
A table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want 📊

What are passkeys?
Passkeys are secure, easy-to-use alternatives to passwords. Instead of remembering your password, you can sign into Notion using the same method you use to unlock your device. Behind the scenes, passkeys use public-key cryptography to create unique security keys that work only with your Notion account.
Passkeys are simpler and more secure than passwords, even withtwo-step verificationenabled. Since passkeys are stored on your device and require biometric authentication like Face ID or Touch ID, they provide better protection against phishing attacks than traditional login credentials.

Note:In order to use passkeys,youcan’tbe in an organization that requireslogin using an identity providersuch as Okta, Microsoft Azure, or Google Workspace.

FAQs
Do I need to set up a passkey to use Notion?
Passkeys aren’t required for Notion users, but we highly recommend them as an extra layer of security to protect your work.
Note that this feature is designed for users whodon’t useSAML SSOto log into Notion.
Can I set up different kinds of passkeys at the same time?
Yes, you can set up up to five passkeys — for example, you could have one that uses your browser and one that uses your password manager. You may consider setting up multiple passkeys so you always have a backup.
I use verification codes to log into Notion. Can I still setup passkeys if I don’t have a password for Notion?
Yes, you can use passkeys with or without a password.
What are the costs or fees associated with passkeys?
Passkeys are available across all plan types. There are no additional costs or fees to use passkeys with your account.
What if I lose my phone or verification device that I use for passkeys? How do I log in?
You can simply use another sign in method. You can continue to log in with Google or Apple, or enter your email and use the verification code you’re sent to sign in.
How do I troubleshoot issues with passkeys?
If you can’t access your passkeys, we advise that you use a different login method and go to your settings to update your login methods. If you continue to have issues, please contact our support team.
I’m a workspace owner. Can I enforce passkeys for everyone in my workspace?
Unfortunately, workspace owners can’t enforce this feature for all users in their workspace at this time. We’d love to hear your feedback — if this is something you need for your workspace, please reach out and let us know.

Accepted payment methods
On Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, or Apple Pay. If you're in Europe, we also accept payment through SEPA direct debit (not credit transfer). You can also useStripe Linkto pay with a saved card or save your card for future use on any Stripe checkout. Notion usesStripeto process payments.
On an iOS device, you can pay with Apple Pay. Unfortunately, you can't make payments in the Android app at this time.
If you pay with debit or credit card, you're charged upfront for the month or year you're about to spend on Notion. If you pay with SEPA direct debit, you’ll receive a debit notification email. If you have been approved to pay via ACH or bank transfer, you'll receive an emailed invoice on the first day of your billing interval.
Payments for subscriptions you purchase on mobile can be managed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. If you've purchased a subscription through the Apple App Store, you'll need to contact the Apple App Store directly for any issues with your subscription, including cancellations and refunds.

Note:All valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they can’t be reinstated.
SEPA
If you’re using SEPA for the first time to pay for your Notion plan, note that payment must fully process before you can make any changes to your plan, add or remove AI, or update your payment method. We also won’t be able to assist with refunds while your payment is processing.
You can, however, add or remove members from your workspace during this time. These changes will be reflected in your next invoice.

Policies
Notion maintains a comprehensive privacy compliance program and is committed to partnering with its customers and vendors on privacy compliance efforts. This page highlights some of the key aspects of our program.
How we handle your data
At Notion,our team is dedicated to developing and implementing data privacy processes and safeguards that meet industry standards and best practices. We conduct ongoing training for our teams to ensure that they are up to speed with developments in legislation and essential privacy and security practices.
Every Notion employee and contractor signs up to non-disclosure terms to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data. Notion also holds any vendors that handle personal data to the same data management, security, and privacy practices and standards to which we hold ourselves.
What is Customer Data?
Notion defines Customer Data as any data that a customer stores in the Notion services. This can include personal information.
Customer data does not include analytics data or Account Information, which we describe below. The terms of the NotionMSAand NotionDPAapply to your Customer Data.
What is Account Information?
Account information is the information that our customers provide to us so that we can create and administer their customer accounts.
For example, account information includes names, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, email addresses, Workspace metadata, support communications, billing information, and usage information associated with your Notion account.
The terms of the NotionPrivacy Policyapply to any personal information included in Account Information.
Who owns and controls Customer Data?
You own your Customer Data, including any content you submit or upload to the Notion Service.
You control your Customer Data. You determine what content and data will be uploaded to  Notion. Once Customer Data is uploaded you manage access to your workspace by allocating user logins to individuals.
You also control the administration of the Customer Data by managing you groups, permissions and the user credentials that are under your control.
How does Notion use my Account Information?
The NotionPrivacy Policydescribes in detail how Notion collects and uses your account information.
Who should I contact if I have any questions about Notion’s data protection practices?
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at:
Notion Labs, Inc. 2300 Harrison Street San Francisco, CA 94110 United States[email protected]
GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that governs the collection of and use of personal data of EU residents, and that allows data subjects to exercise control over their data.
As the GDPR is widely considered to be the most stringent global privacy standard, we have mapped our privacy program to the GDPR and other global privacy regulations.
Notion as Processor and Controller
The GDPR and other data protection legislation have two primary classifications related to the collection and processing of personal data: data controller and data processor.
A data controller determines the means and purposes for processing personal data, while a data processor is a party that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
Where our customer is a data controller or data processor, Notion is the data processor of personal data that our customer and their users upload to the Notion service. We process any such personal data at our customer’s direction and on our customer’s behalf. We conduct this processing in accordance with Notion’sData Processing Addendum.
Cross Border Transfers - Standard Contractual Clauses
We understand and adhere to the rules for international transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area and UK.
In order for our customers to be confident of Notion’s data transfer processes ourData Processing Addendumincorporates both the EU and UK Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). In response to the Schrems II ruling, our DPA lists the technical and organisational measures we employ to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when we transfer personal data to countries outside of the EEA and UK.
For more information about our technical security measures, please see oursecurity page.
Transfer Impact Assessment
Notion understands and appreciates the importance of maintaining transfer impact assessments (TIA) as a supplementary measure and as a critical piece of your privacy compliance program.
To assist our customers in completing these assessments,we maintainTransfer Impact Assessment pagethat includes all of the information about Notion that you need to complete your TIA.
Subprocessor List
We work with certain companies and tool systems to provide our services to you. All of these companies have been carefully vetted for best-in-class security and data privacy practices. For more information,please see ourlist of subprocessors.
Data Governance
Data governance relates to the policies and procedures that dictate how data is procured and used throughout its life cycle. From creation and collection to processing, distribution, storage and deletion.
Notion’s commitment to data governance is key to keeping our users data secure, private, accurate, and accessible.
Privacy by Design
At Notion, we believe in privacy by design, which means that privacy considerations are built into every aspect of our products and services from the outset. This includes the development of new products, features, and the selection of vendors.
Notion conducts regular training with our personnel to reinforce the concept that Notion needs to think of user privacy at all stages of the development lifecycle.
Data Export
Companies generally have a duty to back up their information in multiple places. To help with this Notion offers the option to save any Notion page, database, and non-database page to your computer in various formats. This way our customers can further protect themselves by backing up their information at any time.
Data Import
Notion’s data import function lets you upload information from external sources and combine it with the data already held in your workspace.
Like most people, you probably have data, documents, and notes scattered across many files and apps. You can centralize your information in one place by moving it all into Notion.
Data Deletion
The workspace owner controls the workspace’s Customer Data. This includes all of the content submitted by customers and their users. When users leave a workspace, they may have the right to request that their data is deleted by the workspace owner. When customers terminate their subscription they also have the right to request that their data be deleted by Notion.
Notion allows forAccount DeletionandWorkspace Deletion.
When you delete an account, Notion will:
Delete the account associated with that email address

Data Access
Notion provides an advanced set of access functionality to help customers effectively protect their information. Notion also uses encryption to protect Customer Data from outside access.To learn more about how data access works at Notion please see ourData Access Consentpage.

Relations & rollups
Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.
Have you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases 🛠

What is a database relation?
Let's say you have two databases for your theoretical business 😉
One that tracks customers
One that tracks customers
One that tracks items purchased

You want to know both which customers bought which items, as well as which items were purchased by which customers. This is a job for relations!
In the two tables above, the columns labeled↗ Items Purchasedand↗ Customersare relation properties, which can be added like any other database property.

Here, when you add an item bought into theCustomersdatabase, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the↗ Customerscolumn in theItemsdatabase.

Create a relation
To relate two databases, you need two databases. So let's assume you've made theCustomersandItemsdatabases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.
Add a new column/property to yourCustomersdatabase and give it a name, likeItems Purchased.

Now when you click in a cell in this relation column, you'll bring up a menu where you can search for and choose items from the other database to add.For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click the–button on the right.

Tip:To change the database you're connecting to, re-selectRelationas the property type for that particularly property. You'll be prompted to choose a new database.

Two-way relations
Relations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.
With two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to theItemsdatabase in the relation column, the change pops up in yourCustomersdatabase.
Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.

View and remove related pages
When you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another.
These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.

If you select the option to limit it to1 page, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.

This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.
Display options for relations
To change how relations are displayed in a database page:
While in a database page, click on the relation.
While in a database page, click on the relation.
ClickProperty visibilityand selectAlways show,Hide when empty, orAlways hide.
ClickProperty visibilityand selectAlways show,Hide when empty, orAlways hide.
Customize displayed properties for relations
When you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, let’s say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!
To do this:
Open a page in a database that has a relation property.
Open a page in a database that has a relation property.
Click the field next to that property to link a page → click•••.
Click the field next to that property to link a page → click•••.
In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out ofShown in relationorHidden in relation.

Once you’re done, you’ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database.
Once you’re done, you’ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database.
Relate a database to itself
Let's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.
Start off by creating a new relation.

Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.

Rollups
Rollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.
First, create the relation so you know who bought what.
First, create the relation so you know who bought what.
Add a new column/property and chooseRollupfrom theProperty typemenu. Give it a descriptive name.

Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:The relation property you want to roll up.The property of those related pages you want to roll up.The calculation you want to apply to them.

So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation propertyItems Purchasedand thePriceproperty within those pages. Then you'd chooseSumas the calculation.Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.

Rollup types
There are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:
Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.
Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.
Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.
Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.
Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.
Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.
Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.
Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.
Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.
Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.
Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.
Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.
These rollup calculations are only available forNumberproperties:
Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).

FAQs
Can I export or import relations?
When you export a relational database as a CSV file, the relation properties will export as plain text URLs. For now, you can't re-import that CSV back into Notion to re-establish the relations with other databases.
Can I duplicate a database with a relation?
Yes. In the example above, if you duplicate the Customers database, the duplicate database, Customers (1), will not show as a relation in the Items database. That’s because upon duplicating the Customers database, we convert the relation from a 2-way sync to a 1-way sync. If you'd like, you can always convert the relation back to a 2-way sync.
Can I rollup a rollup?
Unfortunately not, as this could create unintended loops. We recommend sticking to rolling up other properties 😊

Reminders
Notion can help remind you or other people about what’s important ‼️
Create a reminder in a page
Create a reminder for someone else in a page
Create a reminder in a database
How reminders work
When you add a reminder, Notion will send you a notification to draw your attention back to a particular task, event, or page at the date or time you specify. This is helpful for setting due dates and making sure you never forget a thing.
Create a reminder in a page
To create a reminder in a page:
In a page, type@remindfollowed by a time, date, or both, as in@remind tomorrow,@remind 7pm, or@remind Wednesday at 1pm. This will create a blue tag.
In a page, type@remindfollowed by a time, date, or both, as in@remind tomorrow,@remind 7pm, or@remind Wednesday at 1pm. This will create a blue tag.
Click the reminder. In the calendar window that opens, edit the date and time of your reminder, when you want to be reminded (i.e. 30 minutes beforehand), and change the date format and timezone.
Click the reminder. In the calendar window that opens, edit the date and time of your reminder, when you want to be reminded (i.e. 30 minutes beforehand), and change the date format and timezone.
Inline reminders turn red when they change to @Today or are past due.
Create a reminder for someone else in a page
You can create reminders for other people in a page (but not in a database). To do this, make sure to mention the person’s name in the same block as the reminder, as in@Alyssa @remind next Monday 9am to review this proposal.
Create a reminder in a database
You can create reminders in a database if the database has aDateproperty. To set up a reminder in a database:
Click on theDateproperty for a particular database page.
Click on theDateproperty for a particular database page.
In the calendar window that opens, edit the date of your reminder, when you want to be reminded (i.e. 30 minutes beforehand), add a specific time, and change the date format and timezone.

How reminders work
When you set a reminder, you (or the person you’re reminding) will be notified at the chosen time in a few ways:
A red badge will pop up next toInboxat the top of the left sidebar.
A red badge will pop up next toInboxat the top of the left sidebar.
A push notification will be sent in the Notion desktop app.
A push notification will be sent in the Notion desktop app.
A push notification will be sent within five minutes of the reminder time in the Notion mobile app.
A push notification will be sent within five minutes of the reminder time in the Notion mobile app.
If Notion isn't open at the time of the reminder, both a mobile push notification and an email will be sent.
If Notion isn't open at the time of the reminder, both a mobile push notification and an email will be sent.

FAQs
How can I trigger a reminder for someone else on my team?
The best way to do this is to use an @-mention and @-remind on the same line. For example:
@Camille Ricketts @remind next Thursday 4pmto finish proofreading
Does Notion have recurring reminders? Like "remind me every Monday to water the plants"?
Not at the moment, but recurring tasks and recurring reminders are on the roadmap!

Choose a setup method (URL or metadata XML), paste the required information from your Identity Provider or IdP, and selectSave & enable.

Note:At this time, organizations on the Enterprise Plan can only set up SAML SSO with one IdP.
Enforce SAML SSO
Once you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for a workspace, members will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other login methods, like username and password or Google authentication.
If you want to ensure that members can log in using only SAML SSO and no other method, go to your SAML SSO settings and update the Login method to Only SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO. SAML SSO will only be enforced for members who use your verified domain.
On the Business Plan, this will look like this:
On the Enterprise Plan, this will look like this:
SSO bypass
In the event of IdP or SAML failure, certain users will be able to bypass SAML SSO by using their email and password credentials. They’ll be able to log in and disable or update their configuration.
If a SAML configuration is managed at the organization level, only organization owners will be able to bypass SSO.

If a SAML configuration is managed at the workspace level, only workspace owners will be able to bypass SSO.
If a SAML configuration is managed at the workspace level, only workspace owners will be able to bypass SSO.
Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning
Notion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the workspace automatically as a member.
To enable Just-in-Time provisioning if you're on the Business Plan, go toSettings→Identityand make sure thatAutomatic account creationis enabled.
To enable Just-in-Time provisioning if you’re on the Enterprise Plan, go to your organization console →Generaland make sure thatAutomatic account creationis enabled.

Note:We don’t recommend enabling Just-in Time provisioning if you are using SCIM. Having an “allowed email domain” in place allows users on that domain to join the workspace so there could be a mismatch between membership in their Identity Providers and Notion.

FAQs
Why is the current Enable SAML SSO greyed out?
The most common reason is that you have not yet verified ownership of a domain. If this is the case, you'll notice that you either don’t have any domains listed in the verify email domain section or the domain is pending verification.
For next steps,refer to our instructions on how to complete domain verification here →
Why can’t I edit my SAML SSO settings?
It's possible you'retrying to modify the verified domains or SSO configuration from a linked workspace that's already associated with another SSO configuration.In linked workspaces, all domain management and SSO configuration settings are read-only. To modify the SSO configuration or remove this workspace from the SSO configuration, you must have access to the primary workspace. The name of the primary workspace can be found at the top of theIdentity & Provisioningtab in your settings.
Why do I need to verify a domain to enable SSO?
We ask that the email domain ownership is validated to ensure that only the owner of the domain can customize how their users log into Notion.
I'm having trouble setting up SSO.
Try using a URL instead of an XML.

Test the setup process with a test account before enforcing it for users.

If neither of these options help, reach out to support at[email protected].
If neither of these options help, reach out to support at
[email protected].

Why should I remove email domains from the “Allowed Email Domains” setting before configuring SAML SSO for my workspace?
TheAllowed Email Domainsetting allows users with the selected domains to access your workspace without being provisioned via your IdP. To ensure that only users provisioned via your IdP can access your SAML-enabled workspace, disable this feature by removing all email addresses from theAllowed Email Domainlist.
Can I still log in to Notion if my Identity Provider (IdP) is out of service?
Yes, even with SAML enforced, workspace owners have the option to log in with email. A workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disableEnforce SAMLso users can log in with email again.
How do I allow admins of other workspaces in my SAML configuration create new workspaces?
Only the admins of your primary workspace will be able to create new workspaces using your verified domain(s). Please reach out to our support team ([email protected]) to switch your primary SAML workspace to another linked workspace in your SAML configuration.

If there was a disaster with Notions Systems and my Notion Instance was impacted, how does Notion restore itself?
Notion performs daily automated backups of all customer and system data to protect against loss due to unforeseen events across separate availability zones in AWS US West-2 andAWS US East-2.
We have a dedicated Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan for these circumstances, and our Disaster Recovery Plan is tested at least annually to ensure Notion will recover from a disruption resulting from a disaster.
Can Notion employees access our information?
Notion employees will only ever access your data for the purposes of troubleshooting problems or recovering content on your behalf. Please refer to ourData Access Consentfor further information.
Will other people be able to see my pages?
Your data is safe in Notion! If someone tries to navigate to your workspace without having access, they’ll see a page that lets them know that they do not have the correct permission state to access that content.
If you enableShare to webin theSharemenu at the top right of a page, it will publish that page to the web so that anyone with the link can access it. This is always turned off by default.
If you’re sharing a workspace with others, some pages will be visible to everyone in the workspace, or specific groups of people — this is based on the permissions you see in theSharemenu at the top right of the page.
Please note, if you are using an account in an enterprise workspace, your content may be accessed by the workspace’s workspace owner. Learn more inour Personal Use Terms of Service.
Can I opt out of Notion's tracking/analytics?
Yes you can! This will also disablein-app message support, but you can still reach out to us for help at[email protected].
Just send a message to our support team at that address and we'll opt you out.
My browser alerted me that Notion is using trackers. What do these trackers do?
We use tracking code in order to effectively run ads (for example, tracking a visit to our marketing site). We isolate this to a sandboxed iframe on a subdomain (aif.notion.so) — it's never activated on user pages.
No user content is exposed to any third-party service.
Does Notion review findings from Third Party Risk Assessment Platforms (i.e. Security Scorecard, Bitsight, Upguard)?
We understand that many organizations use third-party risk assessment platforms for security due diligence. However, we’ve noticed that these platforms often produce unreliable and incorrect results, and addressing these incorrect findings is costly and distracts from important cybersecurity work. Therefore, our policy is to not always respond to inquiries or findings from these platforms. This approach allows us to focus our cybersecurity resources on what truly matters for Notion and our customers.

Eligible countries
Marketplace is the best place to feature and sell your templates to Notion users. All the tools you need to manage your products, see how they are performing, reach your customers, and build your business are right inside of Notion.
Create a creator profile
To sell in Marketplace, you’ll first need to go tohttps://www.notion.so/profileand set up your creator profile. This is a profile that’s separate from your Notion profile, where you can showcase your templates, add a profile photo and cover photo, and share more information about yourself.
Get verified for payments with Notion
Notion uses Stripe to process payments. Creators will need to join the waitlist, get approved by the Notion team, and onboard with Stripe to start selling directly on Marketplace. To see if you’re eligible, see the list of eligible countries below →

Note:
You don’t need to onboard with Stripe unless you want to sell your templates and process payments directly through Marketplace. We do still support linking to 3rd party payment sites.
You don’t need to onboard with Stripe unless you want to sell your templates and process payments directly through Marketplace. We do still support linking to 3rd party payment sites.
Once you successfully onboard to payments via Stripe, your existing paid templates (at their existing Notion Sites links) will be made available for purchasedirectly on Marketplace. This means that users who access your templates' existing Notion Sites links via a third-party platform won’t be able to duplicate your templates. Make sure toduplicate your template and set it up at a new Notion Site linkthat you can use for your listing on the third-party platform.

Access locking

Note:Access locking is only available for templates that you sell through Notion, or list for free, directly on Marketplace.
Access locking is a great way to protect the content you've created in your template, available when selling and distributing your template on Marketplace. With access locking, you can protect your templates and their contents from being redistributed by other people.
Once a user has added your template to their workspace, it can be duplicated multiple times in that Notion workspace. However, the user won’t be able to move the template to another workspace usingMove toor by sharing. This means duplicating your template to another workspace or copying certain blocks from the template and pasting them into a page in another Notion workspace won’t be allowed.
Payment
Selling on Marketplace lets you share your creations with a wide audience alongside other trusted, verified creators. When processing payments through Notion:

Note: Changing identity providers does not end user sessions or deactivate users.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors when setting up SAML SSO, check to make sure your IdP's metadata, SAML requests and responses are valid XML against the SAML XSD schemas. You can do so usingthis online tool.
Note that we do not support theEntitiesDescriptorelement. If your IdP's metadata contains this element, extract the containedEntityDescriptorelement and try again.

Yes, profilePhoto is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your IdP, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profilePhoto field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.
Can I still log in to Notion if my Identity Provider (IdP) is out of service?
Yes, even with SAML enforced, workspace owners have the option to log in with email. A workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disableEnforce SAMLso users can log in with email again.

Shared Responsibilities Model

2. Why the Notion SRM is important
3. Structure of Notion's SRM

User Responsibilities:
4. Detailed User Responsibilities
Access & Authorization Management

Data Management:
1. What is the Notion Shared Responsibilities Model?
Notion is a single space where you can think, write, and plan. As an all-in-one space that allows users to build their own tools for doing their best work, users entrust Notion with professional and personal information.
A Shared Responsibilities Model (SRM) is a framework that outlines the division of responsibilities between a service provider (e.g., Notion) and its users. It clearly defines which security and operational tasks are handled by each party.
This document outlines the responsibilities that Notion and Notion users (Users) share in protecting & maintaining the security of Notion, Notion’s systems, Notion’s user accounts, and Notion’s workspaces.
2. Why the Notion SRM is important
The Notion SRM provides clarity both for Notion and its users on which party is responsible for each type of security. This allows Notion to focus on, and take responsibility for, areas where we can best support the security of Notion’s systems, while demonstrating where Notion users are better suited to secure their accounts. Overall this will enhance security & efficiency in protecting Notion systems and accounts.
Additionally, the SRM promotes transparency in how Notion services are delivered, and who is responsible for maintaining access to which Notion systems. This also ensures Notion and its users maintain compliance with applicable local, regional, national, and international regulations.
3. Structure of Notion's SRM
In short: Notion is responsible for maintaining, upgrading, and protecting the systems which underpin Notion, while Notion users are responsible for protecting their account access credentials, managing workspace access for members & guests, and adhering to theContent & Use policyand other relevantTerms.
Notion's Responsibilities:
Notion is responsible for maintaining and upgrading its systems, including Notion’s servers, software, and corporate hardware. Notion is also responsible for protecting access to its core systems, and ensuring the security of its data. It is also Notion’s responsibility to implement and manage network security across its systems.
User Responsibilities:
Users are responsible for protecting their login credentials, and restricting access to Notion workspaces to known & trusted collaborators. Users are expected toadhere to Notion’s policiesregarding data storage and management, including by only storing appropriate materials in Notion, and maintaining data in-product securely. Additionally, Users are expected to comply with Notion’s Terms and other relevant policies at all times.
4. Detailed User Responsibilities
Access & Authorization Management
Users have the ability to implement granular permissions for shared content, in addition to general account access. Users are expected to regularly review and update access permissions across their workspaces. Users who choose to access Notion with a password are expected to use strong, unique passwords to access the services and avoid credential proliferation through re-use on other services. Users should also update login credentials in accordance with their own internal policies and as relevant when external login credential breaches are discovered.
Authentication Controls
We expect Users not to share login information with other Users or interested parties. Where possible, Users are strongly encouraged to implement two-factor authentication methods to further secure their accounts. Users are expected to maintain individual accounts, not shared accounts. Users may manage team member access to grant additional collaborators access to relevant pages and workspaces, and are able to granularly manage permissions to ensure proper access is granted to each member.
Access Monitoring and Review
Users are also expected to monitor member activity act appropriately upon discovering suspicious activity, including revoking unauthorized or outdated user sessions (available via Enterprise plan). When a User’s team member is departing their team or workspace, Users are expected to revoke access for that member and all associated accounts.
5. System Usage Guidelines
Responsible Use:
Users are expected to use Notion's systems responsibly and within their intended capacity. This includes avoiding actions that could overload or strain system resources. Users must not attempt to circumvent or test system limitations or security measures. If Users become aware of potential security vulnerabilities or witness system misuse, they should promptly report these incidents to Notion.
Data Management:
Users are responsible for maintaining proper data management practices, including creating regular backups of important information, following established data retention policies, and ensuring the timely and secure deletion of sensitive information when it is no longer required. Users are expected to submit complete and accurate Account Data to Notion. If a User discovers that incorrect data has been submitted, they are expected to promptly correct the information submitted.
By adhering to this Shared Responsibilities Model, both Notion and its users contribute to a secure, efficient, and productive workspace environment.

Teamspaces are dedicated spaces for every team within your organization or company. Each teamspace has its own members and permission levels, which can be customized by its teamspace owners.Learn more about adding members and assigning permissions in teamspaces →
There are two ways to share Notion pages with any teamspace that you’re a member of:
Hover over the name of a teamspace in your sidebar and create a new page inside of that teamspace by clicking the+that appears.

When you share a page with specific workspace members, the page will appear in theSharedsection of your sidebar. Learn more about sidebar sectionshere →
Share with guests

Note:
If you’re not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because:Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest you’re trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace.

If you’re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you selectInvitein the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.

Guests are people who aren’t part of your Notion workspace. This could be a contractor or a client you’re working with. Learn more about guestshere →
Once you’ve invited someone to your page as a guest, they’ll receive an email with a link to the page. To access your page, your guest will need their own Notion account.
Stop sharing
Seeing other people in a page you didn't mean to share? Want to make a page private? There are a few ways you can stop sharing your pages with others:
In your sidebar, drag a page into yourPrivatesection so that only you can see it.

Permission levels
For every person, group, or teamspace you share a page with, you can assign a different permission level. This helps to keep private information private and gives you granular, precise control over your work.
Here are the different permission levels in Notion:
Full access: People with full access to a page can edit any of the content it contains and share the page with anyone they want.
Full access: People with full access to a page can edit any of the content it contains and share the page with anyone they want.
Can edit: Select this level of access for people who should be able to edit the content on the page, but not share the page with others.
Can edit: Select this level of access for people who should be able to edit the content on the page, but not share the page with others.
Can edit content: This permission level is only found ondatabase pages. People with this level of access can create and edit pages within the database, and edit property values for those pages. However, they will not be able to change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts, or filters.Learn more about databases here →

There are also different actions that people can take in a workspace depending on their role in the workspace. To learn more, readthis article →
Edit permission levels

Note:If someone has requested a change in their permissions on a page you own, you’ll be able to see, approve, and reject those requests from yourInbox.
To change someone’s permission level for a specific page:
SelectShareat the top of the page.
SelectShareat the top of the page.
Open the dropdown next to the name of a person, group, or teamspace with whom the page has been shared.
Open the dropdown next to the name of a person, group, or teamspace with whom the page has been shared.
Select a permission level.
Select a permission level.
Inherited permissions
When you create a subpage inside of a page, that subpage will take on the permissions of its parent page. To change this, go into a subpage and update the permissions there.
Teamspace owners can set default permissions for content in their teamspace. This will apply to every new page created in the teamspace, and if you want to change them, you’ll have to make changes at the page level.
Permission overrides
Notion respects thebroadest level of accessgiven to a user. For example, let's say you give Member ACan viewpermissions to a page. Then you give everyone in your workspaceFull access, Member A will also get full access because they are member in your workspace.
Additionally, moving a shared page to thePrivatesection of your sidebar will remove everyone else's access on that page.Note:This override will only apply to the parent page — the permissions granted for any subpages will remain the same.
If a page is set to be accessible toAnyone with link, note that even those that don’t have the direct link may be able to access in certain cases including the following:
The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.
The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.

To see these settings, go toSettingsin your sidebar, then selectSecurity.


FAQs
I tried adding a guest to my workspace but they were turned into a member automatically. How can I prevent that?
If your workspace is above the guest limit for yourplan, new users that you share content with will be automatically added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they have the same organization email domain.
To allow for a new user with the same organization email domain to be added as a guest, you will need to remove existing guests to fall below your plan limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).
If your workspace is above the guest limit for yourplan, you may have the Allowed Email Domains setting turned on. When enabled, this feature allows people with that email domain to join your workspace as a member automatically. You can disable this setting in theGeneraltab ofSettingsin the left sidebar.
What’s the difference between sharing my Notion page with anyone on the web with the link and sharing my Notion page as a Notion Site?
If you want to collaborate with a client on a proposal, you might want to use a public sharing link.

If you want to share about your latest travels, you canpublish your Notion page as a Notion Site. This will allow you to turn on search engine indexing to reach a wider audience, customize the look and feel of your page, and more.

My Export button is missing, it doesn't appear in any menus.
You may have theDisable Exportsetting enabled in theSecuritytab ofSettingsin your left sidebar. You'll need to be an admin in your workspace and on desktop to change this.
Can I limit access to different parts of a database? Can you make it so that some people can see certain database views or properties, but not others?
Currently, there isn't a way to share a database while limiting access to specific filters or properties. If one page in a database is more sensitive, you can remove users from that page so that it can’t be seen by everyone with access to the database.
When you share a specific database page with someone, they will be able to see all properties from the database when viewing that page.

FAQs
Can I choose to use just one part of the integration?
Unfortunately, this is not possible today. When you install Notion’s Slack integration you’ll have the full functionality/all features of the Slack integration.
However, since only users with edit access to a page can set up Notion notifications to Slack, you can control parts of the integration by restricting permissions.
What permission level is required to create a database notification?
A user needsFull Accessto a Notion database to be able to set up database notifications.
Anyone with at leastViewaccess to a database can see all the existing Slack notifications that have been set up. However, they can’t edit or create any themselves.
How do permissions work when I share a Notion page in a Slack channel?
The user that shares the pagewill get a prompt informing them some people in the channeldon't have access to the doc. The user is then able to decide if they want to share the page with the people that don't have access. They also have the option to delete the page preview in Slack.
Can admins control who can connect Slack to a Notion workspace?
As an admin in Slack you can manage settings that give you approval rights for any Slack integration. The same settings will apply to Notion if you choose to turn them on.
On Enterprise plans, Notion admins can also restrict members from installing the Slack integration using their admin permissions to manage connections.
Where can you view and manage the Slack notifications you've set up in your Notion workspace?
Database notifications can be managed and edited in the the individual database they’ve been created in. There is currently no way to see all database notification workflows in your workspace from one central place.
Personal @-mention notifications can be managed fromSettings→Notifications.
When one person connects Notion to Slack, does that turn it on for everyone?
No, when one user sets up the integration all Slack users will be able to see an unfurled Notion page link or a Slack link preview in Notion.
But to use the functionality themselves, other users have to connect Slack individually.
How do I send Slack messages to a specific database view?
The easiest way to send a Slack message to a specific database view (e.g. you might have a view for only your team’s tasks), is to copy the link to the database view and paste that link into the send to Notion prompt in Slack.
When you send a Slack message to a specific database view, the properties are auto-filled for you. No need to update them yourself manually!
Does the @-mentioned notification in Slack work when a user is mentioned as part of a group @-mention in Notion?
Yes. A group mention in Notion will trigger the @mention notification in Slack to all members of the Notion group that have the Slack @mention turned on.
Are there other 3rd party integrations providers and can I continue to use them (e.g. Zapier)?
Yes. Those integrations will continue to work as before.

ID URLs
All pages with the ID property can be accessed via a special URL with the ID number. For example, if a page has the ID:TASK-123you can get to that page atnotion.so/TASK-123.
Unique ID URLs will only work if your unique ID has a prefix.To make sure your unique IDs contain a prefix, click on the ID property in your database, selectEdit property, and check that thePrefixfield is not empty.

Note:Unique ID numbers always start at 1 and are assigned to every page, including deleted pages. ID numbers will never change.
Create a sprint
To use Sprints, you must have a Task database in Notion. You can turn any database in Notion into a Task database followingthese instructions.
Once you have a Task database, you can add Sprints to your set-up. To do this:

What is a block?
Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱

FAQs
Is there a way to add background colors to specific cells? Or conditional formatting?
Not at the moment, unfortunately. It's a popular feature request though, so definitely on our radar! For the time being, you can use Select and Multi-select properties to add a pop of color to your table 🎨
Why can't I delete the Name property?
Our tables are a lot different than traditional spreadsheets, since each row represents a database entry that can be opened as its own page, or visualized in other database views. TheTitleproperty gives you access to database pages. That said, you can drag the column left or right to re-order it however you want!
I don’t want my database pages to open on the side or in the center of my page. Is there anyway to open a database page in full-screen by default?
Yes! To do this:
Open the settings menu at the top of your database.
Open the settings menu at the top of your database.
SelectLayout→Open pages in→Full page.
SelectLayout→Open pages in→Full page.

Does Notion have simple (non-database) tables?
Yes!Learn more about simple tables here →
How can I turn a full page database into an inline database?
If it's not already, drag the database from your sidebar into another page. It will become sub-page

Notion offers creators the ability to sell templates on the Marketplace (“Paid Templates”).

You acknowledge Notion’s right to charge transaction, payment, and/or listing fees (“Notion Fees”) as may be communicated to you from time to time either directly or in Documentation. “Payment Processor” means the third party payment processor that processes fees related to a Paid Template.
You acknowledge and agree that Notion may, at its sole discretion, initiate a refund related to any Purchase Fee (defined below) paid by an End User in connection with an End User’s purchase of one of your templates in the event that Notion determines such a refund is appropriate or as described in the Documentation or otherwise. Without limiting any other rights afforded Notion with respect to such refund, the parties acknowledge and agree that any refund may be processed through the Payment Processor and taken out of your Payment Processor account and returned to the relevant End User. In addition to a refund of the Purchase Fee, you will be responsible for payment of the Payment Processor transaction fee for the refund. In the event of a dispute or chargeback related to an End User purchase of a Paid Template, you will bear the financial responsibility for any such fees imposed by the relevant card network or payment processor and authorize Notion to deduct or charge such fees to your account with the Payment Processor.
If You submit a Paid Template, such Paid Template is approved by Notion, and you follow the required registration and listing steps contained herein and as otherwise communicated to you, then you may list the Paid Template on the Notion Marketplace and charge End Users to purchase the Paid Template. Fees collected from the sale of your Paid Template (“Purchase Fees”) must be processed through the Payment Processor account you registered for in connection with listing the Paid Template.

Purchase Fees shall be processed from the End User to You through the Payment Processor with Notion receiving the Notion Fees. Notion may revise the Notion Fees at any time.

You agree to pay Notion the applicable Notion Fees for such services.You will select the pricing for your Paid Template during the listing process based on the options available through the Notion Marketplace. Unless otherwise authorized by Notion, all Paid Templates may only be listed and payable in U.S. dollars. Paid Templates may not be offered through the Notion Marketplace as a mechanism to drive direct or off Notion Marketplace sales (through use of a discount code or otherwise). Should Notion suspect you are engaging in such activity it may suspend or terminate your use of the Notion Marketplace.Payment.Subject to your compliance with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use, for each sale of your Paid Template, we will remit to you the amount we've received for your sale of your Paid Template, less our Notion Fees, and any applicable taxes ("Net Proceeds"), in accordance with Notion’s then standard payment schedule for Paid Templates. You agree to provide the Payment Processor with valid bank account information in your name, so we can remit amounts owed to you to that account via the method we choose. We are entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amount due to you (net of any tax withholding, as further described below) is at least the minimum required payout amount.  You are solely responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, and any other fees you incur as a result of payments made to you.Refund Mechanics. As noted above, we may issue refunds for your Paid Templates to End Users at any time at our sole discretion without liability. If a refund is issued before you receive the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, you acknowledge that you will have no right to receive such Net Proceeds. If a refund is issued after you’ve received the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, we may offset such Net Proceeds from any amounts owed to you or we may require you to pay us back such Net Proceeds. If Notion can’t successfully receive payment for any refunded fees owed by you, Notion may cancel your Notion Marketplace account and remove your templates from the Notion Marketplace. Notwithstanding this section, you agree that Notion shall not be responsible for and will not issue any refunds out of its funds (excluding the Notion Fees for the transaction) related to your Paid Template for any reason, including your failure to support the Paid Template. When these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use terminate, we may withhold all payments owed to you for at least 60 days from the date such payments are otherwise due to you in order to ensure we can offset any amounts refunded to End Users or any other amounts we are entitled to.Taxes. Each party is responsible for the payment of all taxes (including any interest and penalties) in connection with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use that are imposed on that party by law. Each party will be responsible for its own income taxes, employment taxes, and real property taxes. You are liable for all applicable taxes imposed on sales of your Paid Templates to End Users, but we will collect sales tax for such transactions and remit such taxes. We reserve the right to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes payable by you from amounts we owe to you, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment to you. If we were required to collect a tax and did not do so at the time of sale, we reserve the right to later charge you for the applicable tax.
Support
You are solely responsible for providing all support and technical assistance regarding Your Work to End Users who enable Your Work. You acknowledge that Notion has no obligation to provide support or technical assistance regarding Your Work to the End Users of Your Work and you will not represent to End Users that Notion will provide such support. You agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide support to End Users of Your Work.

FAQs
Is there a way to add conditional formatting? Like change the color of projects plotted on my timeline or background color of cells in the table?
Not yet, unfortunately. It's a popular feature request though, so definitely on our radar! For the time being, you can useSelectandMulti-selectproperties to add a pop of color to your timeline 🎨

Why can't I delete the Name property when showing table in my timeline?
Timelines are essentially databases, and databases are essentially lists of items. That's what goes in theNameproperty. All the other data points contained are attributes of these items, like due dates, owners, tags and more. You can't remove theNameproperty because that's the core information contained. You can, however, rename that property to align with whatever you are working on.

I don’t want my database pages to open on the side or in the center of my page. Is there anyway to open a database page in full-screen by default?
Yes! To do this:
Open the settings menu at the top of your database.
Open the settings menu at the top of your database.
SelectLayout→Open pages in→Full page.
SelectLayout→Open pages in→Full page.

Does Notion have simple (non-database) tables?
Yes!Learn more about simple tables here →
How can I turn a full page database into an inline database?
If it's not already, drag the database from your sidebar into another page. It will become sub-page

When can a workspace owner transfer content?
When a user is deleted, deprovisioned, or leaves a workspace, they may leave behind private page content. This feature allows a workspace owner of an Enterprise Plan workspace to transfer this content to another, current user so it is easily recovered.

Note:This process applies on a user’sprivate contentafter they have left a workspace. Content shared with a current workspace member willnotbe transferrable.
A workspace owner is able to reassign the private content of a user who has recently left the workspace if:
The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned).
The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned).
The user had private pages.
The user had private pages.
The user’s private pages were not already reassigned to another user.
The user’s private pages were not already reassigned to another user.
The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago.
The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago.
The workspace is on an Enterprise Plan subscription.

Go toSettingsand click theMemberssection.
Navigate to theRecently leftusers tab.
Navigate to theRecently leftusers tab.
For the user who has been deprovisioned (the “recently left user”), select the destination where you would like to send the deprovisioned user’s private pages.
For the user who has been deprovisioned (the “recently left user”), select the destination where you would like to send the deprovisioned user’s private pages.

All of the deprovisioned user's private pages will appear in the destination user’s sidebar, nested under a new top-level private page.
All of the deprovisioned user's private pages will appear in the destination user’s sidebar, nested under a new top-level private page.

Note:A user who has had all their private pages reassigned will no longer be visible in theRecently leftlist.
Reassign content using the Content Transfer API
Enterprise plan workspace owners can use the Content Transfer API to transfer private pages from recently removed workspace members to another member. This API requires the same eligibility criteria mentionedabove.
To use this API, Enterprise Plan workspace owners can:
Create a new internal integrationwith theTransfer contentcapability.
Create a new internal integrationwith theTransfer contentcapability.

Use the following API call for transferring content:
Use the following API call for transferring content:
curl -X POST '<https://api.notion.com/v1/users/transfer>' \\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\
-H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \\
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
-d '{ "from_user_id": <from_user_id>,"to_user_id":<to_user_id>}'
Thefrom_user_idrepresents the removed user. If you’re using the SCIM webhook, the user_id is included in the payload.
Thefrom_user_idrepresents the removed user. If you’re using the SCIM webhook, the user_id is included in the payload.
Theto_user_idrepresents the recipient of the transferred content. You can retrieve this user_id by querying the Notion Public API using thelist users API endpointor using the API provided by your Identity Provider. For instance, Okta provides thelistAppUsers API. TheexternalIDof the appUser is the notion user ID.

curl '<https://api.notion.com/v1/users>' \\\\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer '"$NOTION_API_KEY"'' \\\\
-H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28"
3. The API will return a failure response if the validation fails. Validations can fail if the from user is still in the workspace, or the workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan. If the validation passes, the API will return a success response and start processing the transfer. When the transfer is complete, transferred content should appear in the recipient's private Notion content. The recipient will also receive an inbox and email notification.
Restore a user's content and access
If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, workspace owners will be able to restore their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership.
To do this, simply add a member back to your workspace and their content and access will be automatically restored once they rejoin.

When you move content from one place to another, your content will be duplicated into the destination workspace or account, and the original content will continue to live where it used to.
When you move content from one place to another, your content will be duplicated into the destination workspace or account, and the original content will continue to live where it used to.
In the process of duplicating pages from one place to another, some content or settings in the duplicated page may be broken. This could include links, relations, permissions, page history, and more. We recommend keeping your original content until you're absolutely sure the duplicated content is set up correctly.

FAQs
Do I need two-step verification?
Two-step verification isn't required, but we highly recommend that you use it as an extra layer of security to protect the contents of your Notion workspace.
I login to Notion through an identity provider. Do I still need two-step verification?
If you login to Notion through SAML SSO (using an identity provider), we recommend setting up two-step verification directly through that identity provider.
What if I lose my phone or verification device?
When you first set up two-step verification, you'll receive a set of six backup text codes. You can use these codes to access your account in the event you lose your verification device.
Each backup code can only be used once. Once all the codes have been used, you can generate a new set in your settings.
If you're having trouble, please contact us at[email protected].
I’m a workspace owner. Can I enforce everyone in my workspace to enable two-step verification?
No, workspace owners can't enforce this feature for all users at this time.

Understanding block usage
Learn more about block usage depending on your plan and how many people are in your workspace 🟨
What is a block?
Block usage
Upgrade to another plan
What is a block?
In Notion, the pages you create can contain much more than plain text. Every page you create can be composed of many blocks — from lines of text to table rows, images, videos, and more. Every piece of content you add is counted as a new block. Learn more about blockshere →
Block usage
Restrictions on block usage apply to workspaces that are on the Free Plan and have more than one workspace owner.*
Plan
Workspace size
Block usage
Free
1 workspace owner only

1,000 blocks per workspace. After this, your workspace will need to upgrade to a paid Notion plan in order to continue creating content.
Plus, Business, Enterprise
1+ workspace owners and/or members
Unlimited
*People added to workspaces on a Free Plan can only join as workspace owners.
We count blocks based on the amount of content created in your workspace since signing up —deleting blocks, or emptying the trash, will not reduce your block count.
Upgrade to another plan
If you find yourself approaching 1,000 blocks in your workspace, it might be worth considering an upgrade to a paid plan. Paid plans offer unlimited blocks and additional features for teams collaborating in Notion. Visit ourpricing pagefor more details.
FAQs
Can I delete blocks to avoid these restrictions?
No, deleting content does not reduce your block count or free up additional blocks. Once your workspace has created 1,000 blocks, it will experience restrictions — regardless of subsequent deletions.
If I’m subject to these restrictions, what happens to my existing content?
You can continue to edit existing content even if your workspace has hit 1,000 blocks.
How can I check how many blocks I've used?
You can see how many blocks you’ve used by going toSettings→Upgrade plan. You’ll also see a notification in your workspace’s sidebar when you’ve used a majority of your blocks so you can plan ahead.
How can I check if I have other members or workspace owners in my workspace?
You can confirm if your workspace has multiple workspace owners by going toSettings→People. Having more than one workspace owner will subject the workspace to block usage restrictions.
Can I archive my teamspaces to avoid block usage restrictions?
No. Teamspaces are not considered blocks, so they don’t count towards block usage.
What if I need more time to figure out if I want to or can upgrade to a paid plan?
Don’t worry! We automatically offer a three-day grace period when your workspace hits 1,000 blocks to help you figure out the right next step.
What are my options if I don't want to upgrade to a paid plan?
If you prefer not to upgrade at this time, you canremove additional membersfrom your workspace so that your workspace has only one member. Workspaces with only one member have access to unlimited blocks. You can add collaborators asgueststo continue working with these users in a more limited capacity.

Just sign up with your school email address and you’ll immediately gain access to these features. Thousands of school email domains are eligible, not just .edu!
For more info & FAQs,visit the Notion for Education page.
How is pricing calculated for the paid plans?
If you upgrade your workspace to one of the paid plans, you will be charged a fee per member.
Guests are free of charge – but they can only access individual pages they are invited to. In other words, guests won’t be able to see all the team pages under theTeamspacessection in the left sidebar.
Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?
Yes! We offer both monthly and yearly billing options, but you save more with yearly billing.Find more information on monthly and yearly pricing for our plans here →
How does adding and removing members work?
Whether you're on a monthly or yearly billing schedule, your account may be charged on a monthly basis if you make changes in membership. If you added members, your account will be charged a prorated amount based on the percentage of the billing cycle left when a user was added. If you removed members, you will not receive credit but instead will still have use of that seat for a different user for the remainder of the billing period.
What happens when I change plans?
Upgrading your plan:Your account will be upgraded and charged immediately. The amount due will be reduced based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time the plan was changed.

How do I cancel my paid plan?
Your Notion subscription, annual or monthly, will automatically renew until you cancel it. You can cancel your subscription by going toSettingsin the left-hand sidebar on a desktop computer, then selectingBilling, thenChange plan. After you cancel, you’ll still have access to all the paid features until the end of your billing cycle.
Learn more about billing inthis article.
What happens if my payment fails? Like if my credit card expires?
Your account email will be notified after each failed payment. Payments may be retried up to 8 times within the next month.
After this, if the payment did not succeed, your workspace will get restricted to limited-access for a period of time before being downgraded to the Free plan.

Can I change my payment method?
You can change your payment method at any time in your billing settings.
How do refunds work?
Our refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email[email protected]. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount (not pro-rated) if you downgrade your subscription within three days of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.
If you have accidentally added members to your workspace, you can remove those members at any time. If you’ve been charged for members who were accidentally added, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within three days of the invoice date (please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace when writing in).
And if for any reason you're unhappy with Notion, please let us know at[email protected]— we'd love to hear your feedback, and will be happy to work with you to create the best experience possible.
Do you have a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)?
We do not offer a standard SLA. For teams with greater than 100 members, we can offer a custom SLA.
Contact salesto learn more
How is my payment being processed?
We use Stripe to process your payment. It’s the same payment provider used by products such as Twitter, Pinterest, and Lyft. We do not handle your credit card information directly.
Can I belong to multiple teams on Notion?
Yes! You can use the same email address to create and join multiple teams. However, each one of these workspaces is on its own plan and needs to be upgraded individually.
Can I change my plan settings on mobile?
No, you can only make modifications to your Notion plan on desktop or web.

Label emails

Note:At this time, Notion AI can only add labels to new emails. Notion AI won’t add labels to emails that were in your inbox before your label was created. Notion AI also doesn't work on existing labels you've already created; it only works on labels you create using Notion AI.

Notion AI can filter through your incoming emails, adding certain labels to them and saving them as a view. For example, you can ask Notion AI to label all of your purchase-related emails asPurchases. You could also tag emails from specific senders or email domains. To use Notion AI to auto label your future emails:
ClickAuto labelat the top of your inbox.

Views
Views in Notion Mail surface emails in ways that matter to you. They take what’s in your inbox and display them in unique ways for your convenience. For example, you might set up three different views that show you your emails in three different ways:
A view that organizes your emails by client.
A view that organizes your emails by client.
A view that organizes your emails by priority.
A view that organizes your emails by priority.
A view that organizes your emails by whether they require a follow up or not.
A view that organizes your emails by whether they require a follow up or not.
Views allow for flexibility and customization — for example, you can include emails from across multiple labels in one view, include or exclude archived emails, and group within views for even more granular information. Each views is made up of a unique combination of filters, groups, and properties, which we’ll dive into below.
When you create a Notion Mail account, you’ll see aViewssection of your sidebar with some views already created for you based on the emails and labels you had before. Click into a view to explore how it’s organized. You can also click into the filter, group, and edit icons at the top of any view to see how your current view is configured and customize it based on your needs.

Note:You can’t drag an email from one view into another.
Create a new view
To create a new view in Notion Mail:
UnderViewsin your sidebar, clickNew view.

You can build your own view by providing a description, configuring it manually, or using a template. You can also choose a suggested view.

Once your view is created, you’ll see all of your mail organized in a specific way. You can click the filter and edit view icons at the top of your inbox to see how your current view is configured and customize it however you'd like.
Delete a view
To delete a view in Notion Mail, select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Delete view. Note that you can't delete yourInboxview.
Groups
Groups offer a way to split your view up based on certain characteristics or properties of the emails within. For example, you can group your emails byStarred— this will divide your view into Starred emails and non-Starred emails.
To split your view into groups:
Select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Group→Group by.
Select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Group→Group by.
Search for a grouping option or select one. You can choose to group byDate,Starred,Important,Email or domain,Priority,Label, orUnread.

Filters
Filters allow you to zero in on the emails that are most relevant for what you need. For example, you can set up a filter that removes emails sent from specific email addresses or domains, or a filter that displays emails received between certain dates.
To filter your view:
Select the filter icon at the top of Notion Mail.

Select the label you want to delete →Delete.
Select the label you want to delete →Delete.
Once deleted, the label will also be removed from any emails that previously had the label.
Properties
Views are made of familiar features like filters and groups, but what makes them really powerful are properties. You can create properties that apply to your emails to unlock even more ways of organizing and managing your inbox. Each view can have its own set of properties that it uses.
Some of the key elements of your emails, like their subjects or who they’re from, are already properties in Notion Mail so that you can filter or group by them in a given view.
To see your existing properties in a Notion Mail view:
Select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Properties.
Select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Properties.
You’ll see properties that areShown in mail listorHidden in mail list. Click👁️next to a property to display or hide it.

Let’s pretend that you’re using your Notion Mail account with a Gmail account you created to plan your upcoming wedding. You and your partner both use this email, and you want to be able to mark each email in yourInboxwith who should reply to it. For this, we can create aSelectproperty. To do this:
Select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Properties.

SelectAdd an optionand enter your name. Do the same and enter your partner’s name.
Now, when you open any email in your inbox, you’ll see an option toAdd Who should replyat the top, and you can assign yourself or your partner to that email. You could even create a new view where you group byWho should replyso that you can see all of the emails you need to reply to, followed by all of the emails that your partner needs to reply to! Alternatively, you could create a view that filters by emails that only you need to reply to so you can make your wedding planning a little bit quicker and easier.
Hover actions
In addition to managing your groups, filters, and properties, you can also decide which actions you want to take when you hover over an email. Hover actions can be applied at the individual view level, so you can take specific quick actions depending on the view you’re in! To set your hover actions:
Select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Customize hover actions.
Select the edit view icon at the top of Notion Mail →Customize hover actions.
You’ll see a list of your available actions, as well as actions you can add to your view. Click🗑️next to an action to remove it from your list. ClickAdd hover actionto add another action. Actions include replying, moving to trash, applying a specific label, and marking as spam.

FAQs
I tried using the web clipper on mobile, but got an error message This app is not supported.
Unfortunately, Notion Web Clipper only works for entire pages from your web browser, or photos from your photo roll. It doesn't support other apps yet, like the Twitter app or the iOS Notes app. Definitely possible in the future though!
I tried clipping a web page with the Web Clipper, but some of the page content is missing.
Oops, sorry about that 🙈 If you wouldn't mind sharing the URL with us at[email protected], we'd be happy to flag to our engineering team so they can tweak the clipper accordingly.
Can you add tags to a web page while clipping it?
Not at the moment, unfortunately. Definitely possible for a future iteration though ✂️
For the time being, you'll need to open the clipped page in a Notion database to add and edit any tags or other database properties.
I installed the Safari extension, but am seeing long loading spinners when I try to use it.
Unfortunately, some Safari configurations seem to be causing performance issues across many different Safari extensions, including Notion's. To help our engineering team debug this issue with Apple, could you let us know:
What version of macOS are you running on your computer?

What is a block?
Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱
Everything in Notion is a "block"
Blocks can transform
Blocks can be rearranged
Everything in Notion is a "block"
When you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you've started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!
Imagine every piece of content you add to a page — whether it's text, an image, or a table — as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.
Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out:

What is a database?
Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄
Databases are collections of pages
Databases are pages themselves
Databases have properties
Database views display the same content in different ways
Databases are collections of pages
Think of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database.
This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.
Databases are pages themselves
But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.
Databases have properties
To help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.
You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values. Learn more about database propertieshere →
Database views display the same content in different ways
The contents of a database can be visualized as a table, list, board, calendar, gallery, timeline, or chart — whatever makes the information the most useful.

A Notion workspace can have several types of users or roles:
Members
Members
Guests
Guests
Workspace owners
Workspace owners
(Enterprise Plan only) Membership admins
(Enterprise Plan only) Membership admins
(Enterprise Plan only) Organization owners
(Enterprise Plan only) Organization owners
Read on to learn more about each type of user.
Members
Members are individualsin your company or organization. These could be colleagues at the same organization or people who read, edit, and comment on a lot of the same pages in a workspace.
Members can be added to workspaces on the Free Plan at no charge. Workspaces with more than one member will be able to use up to 1,000 blocks in that workspace. If you want unlimited block usage on the Free Plan, you’ll need to make sure your workspace only contains one person. To do this, you can avoid adding new members, remove existing members, and add any collaborators asguests. You can learn more about thishere →
On paid plans, you’ll pay for each member that’s added to the workspace.
Guests
Guests are individualsexternal to your company or organizationwho you invite into your workspace on a page-by-page basis. For example, guests could be:
People who have a different organization email domain.
People who have a different organization email domain.
Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.

Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.
Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.
Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.
Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.
Guest limits
Unlike members,guests are free to invite to your workspace as long as you stay withinyour plan’s guest limit. If your workspace is above this limit, any new users that you share content with will be automatically added as members and not guests if they have the same organization email domain.
To ensure you’re adding users as guests and not members, you’ll need to remove existing guests so you’re below your limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).
Guests vs. members
Guests share many capabilities with members, except:
They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.

Workspace owners
Workspace owners are admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests. Every workspace has at least one owner. Members can be turned into workspace owners.
Membership admins
Membership admin is a role that exists only in the Enterprise Plan. Membership admins can add or remove members from workspaces or groups, but they don’t have the ability to change workspace settings. Members in an Enterprise Plan can be turned into membership admins.
Organization owners
If your organization has multiple workspaces in Notion, those workspaces can be brought together as one organization. Organization owners are able to view and manage all of their workspaces and members in one central place and apply settings across the board.

Learn how your organization is interacting with content on your workspace 🗃
Accessing workspace analytics
Member engagement
Content analysis
Search behavior
Analytics glossary
Workspace analytics is an Enterprise Plan feature that provides a comprehensive overview of how your organization is engaging with content across the workspace.
With insights on adoption, engagement, and search behavior, you'll be able to fine-tune your workspace to better serve the specific needs of your team.

Note:Your workspace analytics data is tracked starting on the day that you sign up for the Enterprise plan— you will not have any analytics from before that day.
Accessing workspace analytics
To access workspace analytics, click onSettingsin your sidebar and clickAnalytics.
You’ll see an overview of information regarding content in your workspace, including most active teamspaces, viewers and editors.
Select theMembers,ContentorSearchtabs to get more thorough breakdowns. If you’re not a workspace owner, you’ll only have access toContent.
Member engagement
In theMemberstab, you can analyze how members are adopting and engaging with workspace content. You’ll see a graph that displays active members over the last 90 days.
There’s also a list of workspace members with their activity. Note that any member who opts out of analytics will appear with a strikeout eye icon.
Sort by clicking on any of the column titles.You can sort byPage views,Page edits, andLast active.

Content analysis
In theContenttab, you can track how members are engaging with workspace content. By analyzing metrics such as the number of views, number of unique viewers, and last edited date, you can quickly determine which content is most popular or outdated.
This information can help you decide which pages to update, revise, or promote more prominently to your team.

Export your entire workspace

Note:To verify a domain for your organization, you must be anorganization owner.
Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.
If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.
Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.
To export your workspace content:
Go toSettingsin your sidebar.

FAQs
Can I switch between workspaces that are associated with different email addresses?
To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.More on this here →
My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, aTeamspacessection appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and thePrivatesection is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.

When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?
Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.

Note:Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information,click here.

Partial text selection across blocks will be supported on all platforms except Firefox. We’re actively working with the Mozilla team to enable this feature in Firefox as soon as possible.

On mobile
The editing experience is pretty different on mobile than it is on desktop. There are no/commands. And no icons that appear on hover. Instead, all content is created from the editing toolbar located above your keyboard:
Double tap to select text, and drag your selection to include content across multiple blocks.

FAQs
Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?
Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
Is there a way to disable the menu that appears every time I type /?
There's no way to turn this off by default for now, but you can pressescas soon as it pops up in order to dismiss it.
